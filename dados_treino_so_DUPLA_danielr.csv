"I purchased these for my mom and she loves them!  She does not like bold coffee flavors, but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties.

"We picked up a large bottle (45 ounces) of KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce (Original) at our local warehouse store. Our idea was to use it on things done on our little backyard barbecue grill. It has worked well on chicken, beef and pork items. Plus we've cooked with it and used it as a topping, much like you might use ketchup, on beans, meat and a variety of other items. We love the tangy, smoked, woody taste. Ours is an overly large bottle for our needs for we use it only on rare occasions, but it keeps well in the fridge.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0.0
"These cookies have the same old great Pamela's taste, however the box that I received contained 50 packets of broken and smashed cookies.  The cookies are packed two in a foil pouch, 50 pouches in a cardboard shipping box.  Every last one of the pouches was damaged (I assume during shipping) with damage ranging from both cookies broken into two pieces to the more common extreme of opening a pouchful of crumbs.  Still edible, but oh, so annoying.  Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction.",0.0

"If Ranch is your dressing of choice and you are looking for a dressing to fit a special diet need, or simply willing to try something new, try this.<br /><br />I expected this to taste like I was sacrificing something.  I could not have been more happy.  I love the flavor and the zing it has.  I'm not sure if the zing is from an acid, spice, or a personal reaction on the part of my tastebuds.<br /><br />For me, I prefer this to any brand, and any type, of Ranch Dressing.<br /><br />Thank you to Walden Farms for all the products you make available to us!<br /><br />This is something that you have to try and judge for yourself.",1.0

"This is a great deal on this coffee especially w/ subscribe and save. It is a very mild coffee and if you have issues w/ reflux it is very low acid and I have not experienced reflux w/ this coffee. I ordered the medium roast and started mixing it 50/50 w/ another brand of organic decaffeinated coffee that I purchased locally. If you are a french roast or Starbucks fan, you probably will not like it being so mild. I do have to use more beans w/ this type which I did not when I used this brand's Peru decaffeinated light roast which I also found to be low acid.",1.0

"First off, I hadn't had Shake n' Bake since I was a kid and it was always kind of fun to help in the kitchen when ""help"" meant shaking a bag of meat and bread crumbs like a wrapped package at Christmas.<br /><br />It was really very easy to make and a quick process.  Preheat the oven, shake-shake-shake, stick them in to bake and while it's baking see if I can get the side dishes fixed before it's ready to come back out of the oven.  Mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, applesauce etc. all go great with the breaded pork chops.  It's a quick and easy way to get a healthy mid-week meal that everybody wants to eat.",1.0
"This pasta arrived as a hot, messy mush packed IN A BAG not a cooler as another reviewer stated. It's also made with eggs so it's inedible. I didn't know it was frozen when I ordered it.

"We bought this food for our 2 year old Siamese cat after he started having problems with vomiting after eating too fast. The food is designed to encourage chewing so they don't eat so fast (common Siamese problem).  It helped significantly with the vomiting, but even with feeding him the ""overweight"" amount per day, he was still not losing any weight (he weighted 17.5 lbs at his weight in and has a bit of a waddle).  We have now switched him to the Royal Canin Light 40 and he is doing well.  He seems to have a little more energy than normal and loves the food. I was concerned that the smaller pieces would cause the vomiting to reappear, but he hasn't had one problem yet.  Overall the Royal Canin brand is great and I would recommend it to anyone.",1.0
Yum Yum - this stuff is good!  Perfect for adding to protein shakes or greek yougart or just add water for a delicious dip for apples and celery. You can use it as a dry dip for banannas too!  Has made a wonderful addition to my meals and helps keep me on track with my reduced calorie diet.  I love peanut butter but don't miss (or the higher calories) with PB2.,1.0

"Thought I'd try it since I order chicken korma when dining out at Indian restaurants - was quite disappointed as this jar sauce tasted nothing like anything I've ever had - tried adding butter and cream and ground pistachio, cashews and almonds and golden raisins - it only helped a little.

"What I received was not Roland, but HikariMiso. Not a big deal, but kinda weird. I bought this to use in a Vegan mock mac & cheese recipe, and I can tell it's going to be delicious because this stuff tastes so much like cheese it's scary. I'm a miso noob, so I don't have a lot to say beyond that. :D<br /><br />UPDATE: I wasn't sure how white miso is supposed to look, but I've been checking out images online, and what I got is a dark red color, despite the packaging claim that it is white. It doesn't look anything like the white miso images I've seen (light yellow color). Is it spoiled? I called Amazon and they are going to send me a replacement. I'll update again, when I receive it.",1.0
"WOW!  I grew up hating oatmeal - thought it was slimey and reminded me of wallpaper paste.  Could only tolerate it when used as an ingredient in cookies, meatloaf, etc.  First time I ate Silver Palate Oatmeal I was amazed at the difference.  There was actual taste and texture that was good!  I've since tried other rough cut, minimally processed oatmeals but I keep coming back to Silver Palate.  Sometimes I even get a craving for this oatmeal - which I would never have imagined could happen to a confirmed oatmeal hater.",1.0

"I've been a Total junkie for years.  After several successive years of excellent results on my annual physicals, I figure this must be one of the things this old Nam Vet is doing right. However, health food is wasted unless it is combined with regular and strenuous exercise.  Try this for a Total breakfast.  Add two tablespoons of Oregon Blueberries from Amazon.Com and two tablespoons of crushed almonds over your Total.  Sweeten with Splenda. Pour on either skim milk or light soy milk.

"If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!",1.0
"The cat went right for this food, no hesitation.  I rate 4 out of 5 stars because the canned food is too low in protein and fats to use the main pet diet.  I recommend this product with the caveat that you supplement it with additional protein and fats (a dry food would be good).",0.0
"I generally dislike most ""healthy"" bars mainly because they don't taste particularly good.  Like bars are different, they are truly tasty!

"I hate eggs. I developed this aversion to them because my mother used to make me drink them raw when I was a kid. I felt more punished than healed and nothing in the world can make me eat an egg, no matter how well it is cooked. One problem, though, their protein source is excellent. I need the protein but not the egg. My online search finally bore fruit the other day when I came upon Acai matcha tea. This fine tasting tea has more protein than eggs. Hurray! What a relief...",1.0
"Like everyone else, I was a little skeptical.. our family loves peanut butter and and wasnt sure how powdered peanut butter could compare.  We normally buy Smart Balance, very limited ingredients (no stir).,we love it however thought we would give PB2 a try since the calories and fat are significantly lower,  PB2 did not dissapoint! I tried it all by itself, on a celery stick, and this morning in my smoothie.. WOW! Dont think I will ever go back to regular peanut butter.  Cant wait to try some of the other recipes and PB2 Chocolate",1.0
"I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.",1.0

"I usually drink half, wait an hour or so, and finish the bottle. The biggest advantage for me is that I'm not running to the restroom as often with this as with coffee or tea.

I don't drink this everyday, but only when I need help staying awake in a boring class or for a homework assignment.",1.0

"We recently recieved 2 samples of the 5-Hour Energy and my Husband and my Son inlaw used them the next morning. They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard. So in my oppinion the 5-Hour Energy is well worth the cost, and I would buy and use them again. ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.""",1.0

"Amazing gluten free crust!  I had made this for a friend who also has celiac disease, making him the main pizza and me a little mini one, (just big enough for one pepperoni) to try just in case it tasted like so many gluten free mixes-awful-but this tastes like 'real' pizza-if I didn't have self control, poor guy would never have had a pizza to eat!!!  It was delicious, and had a delightful rise and acted like normal wheat dough-I could roll it out and not get sticky.  I am now a maniac for manioc (ha ha!), but truly, a wonderful mix-I went out and tried all the chebe mixes-they're affordable and delicious.  (I've only been gluten free for a few months-not long enough to have forgotten what 'normal' food tastes like and still haven't learned to settle for anything less than the taste and texture I remember from my yummy gluten-filled days.  Well, thanks to the Lord for creating manioc, and to Chebe for  boxing it up for me, I don't have to settle!!!<br />Try this-you won't be disappointed!  Then go buy the cinnamon rolls for desert or breakfast the next morning-again, yum!!!",1.0

"I love this tea and still think it's the perfect epitome of that rich red fruit tea. The hibiscus leaves dominate to give it a sour, anti-oxidant packed flavor. It's kind of like a zinger, except it's the best zinger I've ever tasted. I'm a pretty regular tea drinker and agree that loose leaf is the way to go, but sometimes I'll drink a tea that had to be brewed loose leaf and think, why bother? Too much time and effort for a tea that would taste similar brewed in a tea bag. But with a choice few- genmaicha, a delicate white tea, and this one- it's totally worth the effort and I wouldn't do it any other way.<br /><br />  This tea makes the water into a red, juicy but not overly powerful elixir. It wakes up your taste bugs with it's tartness, gives you just enough sweet to satisfy your craving but not give you a sugar spike to make you crave more. Rich, beautiful, fragrant, delicious. The ingredients are fresh, top notch, it's perfectly blended, and quite simply, it's one of my must-have teas.",1.0
"This might be an excellent cereal, but the boxes that I bought had large pieces stuck together that were hard as a rock and dangerous to the fillings in your teeth.  They can be manually broken apart, but that is a lot of extra trouble.  Other than that, the flavor is good.  It does have a significant amount of fiber, and a reasonable amount of protein.  There is a potential problem with sodium deficiency if you eat too many foods low in sodium (that can cause muscle cramps, especially in your legs).",0.0
"I am so glad that I found this stuff, I was searching for chi chi's seafood enchalada recipe and actually found it and the sherry cream sauce that goes over it calls for this stuff in it, some people however complained about it being to salty but hey, just don't add that much to your recipe LOL without this stuff the sauce would not have tasted as good as chi chi's sauce. LOVED IT!!",1.0
"These were much too salty for me.  I was disappointed as I love pepper but the salt and perhaps other spices overwhelmed the taste of the cashews.  My husband, on the other hand, thought they were delicious which is why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of one.  After three handfuls I had had enough.",0.0

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.",0.0

"I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.<br /><br />Brewing it, it smells pretty intense. Drinking it, it tastes pretty intense. A very strong sour citrus flavor, coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture. After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was, and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix, to see if that improved anything.<br /><br />The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea, but rather, it coagulated into little clumps, making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd, and not improving the flavor in any significant way.<br /><br />Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea, but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations.",0.0

Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.

"I am so excited to see Amazon offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors.

"I can't open this bag.  It is just too beautiful.  Five glorious pounds of gummi.  It sits on my kitchen table.  The rainbow of colors twinkling in the sunlight.  Every time I get close to picking this HUGE bag up, my heart starts racing.<br /><br />These Gummis were made in Turkey and imported into Baltimore.<br /><br />The bag is not resealable so ensure you have some tupperware or a resealable bag when you open it.  A resealable bag is a must.  Gummis that have been exposed to air will harden and lose flavor.  To waste a single, solitary gummi would be a crime.<br /><br />For those who track such things, the average gummi serving is 17 pieces.  That serving will get you 140 calories.  With FIVE pounds of gummis, you will be counting all night long.<br /><br />It takes, on average, approximately 45 minutes for a gummi to melt away in your mouth -- that is, if you can keep it in your mouth that long.  Most people, myself included, will immediately start chewing on the gummi to get at the tasty fruit flavors.<br /><br />Speaking of flavors, let's talk about the goodness that goes into a gummi.  There are many ingredients:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1.<br /><br />I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing.<br /><br />Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis.  My mouth is doing a dance as I type.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.",1.0

"I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.

"But, I will do the best I can.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't expect too much from this, but again, I've never tasted coconut milk or coconut ""water"" as it were.  I've never even tasted natural coconut.  So I go into this review in complete ignorance of what to expect.<br /><br />First negative: The sampler I received was already a day past the ""best before"" date.  Way to go Amazon!  (yes, I know, it's still 'good' for a few days after, but I'm a real stickler for freshness...especially for something I've never had before.)<br /><br />Second negative: The taste.  It's not bad...it's just not good.  If I had to describe it...you know how bananas taste, right?  You know the texture of the banana, especially those little slivers that come off the skin, is a little powdery after you've eaten for a while?  Take that texture, remove the banana flavor, mix it in water, and you've got this.  Or extremely watered down milk.  I just can't see this really refreshing anyone, because there's no ""kick"" to it.<br /><br />So what's good about it?  Well, it's natural.  I give it kudos for that, because there are a lot of non-natural beverages out in the world making us sick.<br /><br />""That's it????""  I mean, what more can I really say about it?  The taste is horrendous, I wasn't refreshed after drinking it, I can't imagine buying this in the store, etc etc.  Sorry I can't put more words to this review, but the above summarizes my reaction as best I can.",0.0

"These chips are very, very good. They are flavorful and crispy and some have a great texture. Some, not all. Unfortunately, about half of the chips are extremely hard to the point where no one in my house will eat them. They are so hard, it's almost impossible to crunch through them! It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.<br /><br />But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!",0.0
"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",0.0
"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",1.0

"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon is a powdered drink mix that can be served using either hot or cold water. The fine powder dissolves quickly and the beverage is mixed and ready to drink in less than one minute.<br /><br />I like the taste of lemons and ginger, but I wasn't prepared for the taste of this beverage. I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.<br /><br />Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage. My enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me, but I would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink.<br /><br />Ginger and lemons might be a nice combination, but they don't mesh very well in this instance. I won't be buying this drink again, as I found it less smooth and less enjoyable than its taste combination promises.",0.0

"When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.

"I've eaten Kasha all my life and I'm 66 years old. We always had it as a breakfast cereal and many times for dinner cooked with onions and chicken broth; on many occasions we added pasta bowties. Today I am a diabetic and kasha is a life saver because it is the only grain cereal I can eat a nice big bowl of and it doesn't 'jack up' my blood sugar and it has a nice glycemic index in that my sugar level remains at a constant level for quite a while and then drops slowly. If I eat oatmeal, cream of wheat, or corn meal mush; my sugar goes above 200 and then drops like a rock after my morning hike. With the same amount of kasha, the level never exceeds 140! Besides the health benefits, it tastes so goooooooooooood!",1.0

"I had to leave a review after reading some of the negative ones. I can't use soy or dairy so finding a milk substitute has been interesting. Many of the soy alternatives still list some soy in their ingredient list. This particular Rice Dream rice milk (organic, enriched, original) does not. Further, it is the closest to dairy milk that I have found and doesn't add it's own flavor to whatever you cook like almond (I like almond milk for some things) or hemp milks do. You certainly can live without the 8 ounce size but they sure are convenient. I do hope that Amazon gets this size back again.",1.0

"My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry.

"I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30.

"The first time I tasted Izze was at a local restaurant who offered a tasting menu of 9 courses. There was an option to pair each course with wine, but I'm not a big wine drinker, so I declined. To my surprise, our server offered a ""soda pairing"" with dinner, and several of the drinks we were served were Izze. They were great! We were served Apple Izze to start off with our appetizer and salad, followed by several other types of sodas - primarily DRY soda and Gus soda. The other Izze I got to try there was the Pomegranate with our steak course. After tasting them at the restaurant, I sought out more flavors to try and was pleasantly surprised with all of them. My favorite by far is this Clementine one. Not too sweet, not too tart - tastes really refreshing.<br /><br />I know everyone's tastes are different, but just in case anyone needs some suggestions on which flavors to try, I would have to rank them in this order: Clementine, Apple, Grapefruit, Blackberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry.",1.0

"This was the first Yerba Mate that I tried. After reading a lot of good things about this tea I thought it would make a good coffee alternative. And I still drink Yerba Mate today, just not this brand. Yerba Mate has a naturally bitter taste to it which takes a bit getting used to. With this particular tea they tried to sweeten it up by adding stevia. However, it just doesn't work. There is still the bitter taste but now you have an additional weird artificial taste that doesn't really improve things. I know stevia is a natural sweetener but I just don't like the taste of it, and therefore I didn't like this tea. The Mate Factor makes loose Yerba Mate that I found much more agreeable.",0.0
"Some time ago I started looking into what is in pet food and was horrified, so I decided to find better food for them.

Whatever the case, the cats are all healthy and love this food.  One of the cats has gained a few too many pounds since she got spayed a couple years ago, so I'm going to get the reduced calorie formula for her and see if that helps.",1.0
"I tried this flour today for crepes.  And they came out fantastic.  The texture is so good that my family and friends did not even realize they were made with gluten free flour.  I read another review here that crepes are not coming out good.<br />Here is my receipe to try.<br />3 eggs, 1/4 cup agave nectar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil - beat on medium until well blended.  Add 1/2 cup of this flour, 1 cup of skim milk, teaspoon of vanilla extract - beat very well until fully blended.  Refrigirate for 30 minutes to let the batter settle and bubbles dissolve.  If consistency is too thick you can add more milk until you get a nice runny batter.<br />This flour has so much rice in it that sometimes your batter will get thicker after it rests.  So it's important to check it after resting to make sure it's thin enough to make thin fluffy crepes.<br />You can also add to the same receipe about 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  They will be even more delicious.",1.0
"My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.",1.0
"Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.",1.0

"I tried both this flavor and the sea salt flavor, and have to say that this was the better of the two.  These snacks are basically puffed grains mixed with cocoa, and covered with cinnamon and sesame seeds.  I expected to like these.  I love chocolate.  I love chocolate mixed with cinnamon.  That said, these snacks simply weren't all that good, and I'm having a hard time on putting my finger on why I don't like them.  I think perhaps it's that there's too much chocolate.  The good thing about these snacks is that I have no desire to keep eating them- there's no addictive impulse here, so I'll quit eating them once my satisfied.  That's also the bad thing, though, as if I'm going to eat a processed snack food I'd like it to be tastier.<br /><br />As for the claims surrounding this product, I think claims of ""antioxidant power"" in processed food are always questionable.  I certainly think they're questionable here.  Without the cocoa (which is what supposedly provides the antioxidant power) this would be a pretty good snack.",0.0

"I love Earth Mama products so I decided to give their Third Trimester Tea a try.  I ordered both Earth Mama and Traditional Medicinals.  There is a big difference between the taste of these two.  While they're both grassy and herby as you would expect, Earth Mama tea has a more pleasant kick to it.  It does not have the bitter aftertaste that Traditional Medicinals has.  I was able to drink Earth Mama without any brown sugar or honey but I had to have something to sweeten Traditional Medicinals.<br /><br />Earth Mama is more expensive but I think it's worth it.  I did not return Traditional Medicinals, I do not hate it, but Earth Mama Third Trimester Tea is definitely better.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do not list the amounts of each ingredient.  That makes it impossible to make a comparison based on potency of ingredients.  Still, I would recommend this product, and would use it exclusively if I hadn't ordered the other brand already.",1.0

My dog does agility so we give her Zuke's when we train. The treat is pretty smelly which is why we use them (a smelly treat will keep her attention).  She will pefrorm for Zuke's they dont seem to be her favorite treat (she performs best for bellyrybs a freezed dried liver which is too big to give as a regular treat)however in training she may eat 10 -15 treats so perhaps she gets tired of them.  The reason for the 4 stars is the treat is semi moist they do tend to dry out if left exposed for too long or if you improperly seal the bag.

"This is a high-quality food, but I think it's best for young, active dogs.  I bought it for my 11 year old mixed breed because he needs grain-free food for his itching.  It worked for that, and he loved the taste.  However, he's had some problems recently, and blood tests showed liver inflammation, as well as elevated cholesterol and very high triglycerides.  NONE of the problems were caused by TOTW, but it's extremely high in fat and protein, so it's exactly wrong as a maintenance diet for a dog like him.  Many older dogs have similar problems, so unless your older dog has had recent, comprehensive blood-testing, you may not want to put him/her on such a rich food.  My dog is improving on a low fat, moderate protein diet.  If I had a young dog getting plenty of exercise, a food with a minimum of 18% fat and 32% protein would probably be just fine.",0.0

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",0.0

It also has tons of electrolytes and tastes good too!  Carbo Pro went in and mixed great with it.  Highly recommend.",1.0
"For around $9, I recieved a small box of 8 crickets. I figured it would be like a delicacy, but upon popping one into my mouth- an overpowering vinegar taste along with an undesireably crunchy/non-dissolving texture(like eating a popcorn seed with vinegar powder) forced me to promptly spit it out. Disgusting, and a huge waste of money.",0.0

"after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be ""ginseng for women"" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to ""draw one's energy"" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's ""good for you"" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?",1.0

No matter what the situation is, I can pop one of either the Dark Chocolate or Extra Dark Chocolate in my mouth and know everything is better.

"First off, with a name like ""vanilla blueberry clusters"" you'd think there'd be some dried blueberries mixed in with the granola, but you'd be wrong here.  It's simply pureed blueberries mixed in with the other flavorings.  I also have to take a little issue with the ""clusters"" part of the name.  Some of the product was in clusters, a bit was in great chunks, but a lot of it is broken down into little pieces or partial pieces of grain and seeds (and those flax seeds are tiny!).  Some of that breakdown may be the way Amazon sent the Vine product sample to me, in a padded mailer, where normally I imagine they'd use a box, but I doubt that was the sole reason.<br /><br />My gluten-free friend liked this product enough to seek it out on her own.  My roommate's toddler enjoyed it and kept asking for more.  I am personally kind of ambivalent about it - I wanted a stronger blueberry presence and more clusters.  I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it (unless shopping for gluten-free snacks for a social event with that friend).  It's nicely crunchy, and the 1/3 cup serving size (120 cal) is reasonably sized for an afternoon snack, and contains 3g each of fat and protein.",0.0

"My 12 lbs (4x 3lbs) of gummy bear arrived yesterday. The candy comes in large(!) resale packaging. I opened up one package right away to check if there is a truth in the complain that many people seem to have with this product.<br />In short: yes, the candy tastes ""older"" than those small packages you can pick up from your local grocery store, but for me this is an advantage:<br />When I buy a package of gummy bears (and it has to be the Haribo brand), I open a package and let it sit for 2-4 weeks to ""ripe"". I can't stand the strong artificial taste/smell of fresh gummy candy products.<br />In my opinion, the longer the gold-bears can breeze, the better the taste gets.

"2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009<br />By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews<br />I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",0.0

"All my dogs like the Blue Dog Bakery treats. They have other treats which smells stronger, but judging from the ingredients the Blue Dog Bakery is one of the healthier treats for them.

I also purchased other Blue Dog treats which are low fat, other flavors, and they're equally popular.<br /><br />These little treats are also great for training because they're bit size, so the dogs don't have to spend a lot of time slowing down chewing them. They're not too small neither which prevents them from being swallowed in haste.<br /><br />One thing to note is that these may not be wheat free.

"I am not sure how long Miracle Noodles have been around, I discovered them sort of by accident.<br /><br />I am about 8 to 10 years late to the low carb lifestyle but I figured any diet that allows me to eat meats and cheeses can't be too terrible.<br /><br />All was fine until I started missing my old carb friend...pasta.  IT was a crippling blow to my diet as I literally went into anxiety mode everytime I saw pasta in a tv show, commercial, movie, read about it...hell, I almost had a breakdown while watching ""Lady and the Tramp"".<br /><br />Almost as a joke I Googled ""zero carb pasta"" just to laugh at myself but something unexpected happened. No, Google did not grow a hand and smack me for being stupid, it actually returned the Miracle Noodle page in the results.<br /><br />I was skeptical...who wouldn't be? It is simply not possible to get a real pasta experience from a plant.  Or so I thought!  On a whim and without doing a terrible amount of research I ordered a ten pack of angel hair noodles. 70 glorious ounces of zero carb/zero calorie noodly goodness.<br /><br />For the record, the following is true:<br /><br />They stink.  Yes, there is an odor when you open the package due to fermenting, but once the noodles are washed and boiled the smell is gone and there is no foul taste associated with the smell.<br /><br />They are flavorless.  Yes, they don't have a starchy flavor so common in pasta and noodles because they are not made from starch. They are simply plant fiber.<br /><br />They have a rubbery texture.  Sort of, but if you follow the instructions this is minimized and the end result is on par with a toothsome al dente pasta. It is not like chewing on rubber bands.<br /><br />The noodles do take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in, sort of similar to the way tofu operates. Because of this, I recommend not using the noodles as you would spaghetti. If you boil your noodles and cover them in pasta sauce you are setting yourself up for disappointment, and the makers of the product know this, hence they give you a recipie booklet to take full advantage of the power of the noodle.<br /><br />I usually make a spicy stir fry in szechuan sauce and add the noodles at the last moments and allow the noodles to absorb the peppery sauce.  The entirte dish has only 4 grams of carbs and is filling.<br /><br />Let's not forget that the noodles are a great source of fiber!<br /><br />Do not go into the order process expecting spaghetti or egg noodles. But if you are on low carb, gluten free, or simply trying to change your eating habits then Miracles Noodles are simply that, a miracle.<br /><br />Thank you Miracle Noodles for allowing me to enjoy my food once again.",1.0

"I absolutely love junk red licorice, so I thought that I would try the Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists since they would probably be a much healthier treat.  The initial taste was okay, yet not quite right... they had a kind of weird wheat flavor and heavier texture, which is not the kind of thing you want to taste when you're thinking red licorice.  But it was the after-taste that left me thinking ""yuck!""  It was just plain strange, almost minty, but again with a grain flavor.  I could not put my finger on what the flavor was, but then after looking at the ingredients list, it made sense: the number one ingredient is wheat!  Now this is much healthier than regular red vines that consist of mainly corn syrup, but I would not ever eat these!  Now, I should mention that all the rest of my family tried them too, some who love sweets and some that do not, and they all thought they tasted fine.  So I guess if you are looking for something sweet to munch on that is a little bit healthier give them a try, but don't think that they will taste like red vines.",0.0

"I have loved this product since the 1970s, when you could get it in individual packets.  If you believe you still can buy Good Seasons Italian in packets and this is the same product, you are about to find out why the restaurants' Italian tastes so much better than when you buy a packet and make it at home.  Some time in the 1980s Good Seasons decided to ""improve"" their single packets of Good Seasons Italian by reworking the recipe (kind of like ""New Coke"" changed the flavor in order to utilize high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar) while the company allowed these 7.6 ounce restaurant ""Food Service"" packages that each make a gallon of salad dressing to remain the old recipe.  Even if you only want to make a single bottle rather than a gallon, no problem---buy this giant envelope, then every time you make a 16-oz Good Seasons decanter with the vinegar, water, and oil markings on the side, just measure out one tablespoon (1Tbsp) of the powder from your 7.6 oz envelope and it equals the single pack contents in the older, better flavored recipe packets! As an added benefit, it costs less than purchasing all those little packets.  Purchasing from Amazon made it an even bigger benefit for me, as for years I was required to buy a carton of a dozen at a time from the local food service supplier, which entailed a big financial outlay and driving 25 miles to the warehouse.  I love going to my computer and purchasing just three envelopes at a time---even better, getting  two units totaling six envelopes meant I didn't have to pay posstage, so it was even a better buy than when I picked up a carton at our local food service warehouse!",1.0

"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it wasn't bad, but I am not really a big watermelon fan and therefore it didn't appeal to me as much as some of the other Switch drinks have. Like the other Switch drinks I have tasted, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, if you like the taste of watermelon then this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one that you should consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, in my opinion, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and that combined with the fact that I am not a big fan of watermelon, would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",0.0

For several reasons, i can't praise this product except to say the label is very pretty, the can has a ring that holds well when you open the can, and the manufacturers use real sugar, not some corn-chemical sweetener.<br />I did open a can of this; the product is pale, liquid, and uses tiny bits of tapioca.  No eggs,although eggs are traditional with tapioca pudding.  If it's used again at our house, (bought a six-pack of this) some kind of protein powder to perk this up will be needed, and how do you keep it from making your stomach burn again?<br /><br />The product is ""a product of its time"",  meaning it is an artificial pudding, very liquid, with artificial colors like tartrazine or yellow number 5, and sunset yellow, or yellow number 6.<br /> So now you know that if you invite friends and family for dinner and some in the group are on the Feingold Diet and are sensitive to and trying to avoid artificial colors and flavors, you cannot serve them this.  Sorry.<br />  In trying to make things easier, looks like  we have made them difficult in other ways.<br />  It might be  really neat if you made your own tapioca pudding rather than using this product, and I'm sorry if that sounds  like a lot work, but  you might enjoy it;  it might take about ten minutes in the microwave, eggs, milk, sugar, tapioca, salt, vanilla.<br /> Recipes with how many and how much are on the internet.<br /> Or it can be made in about twenty minutes uninterrupted using a saucepan on the stove,  Stir  in a figure-8 pattern to avoid scorching, and remove from heat when mixture just comes to a boil.  It thickens as it cools.<br /> As for separating egg yolk from white, for the fancy meringue version of tapioca pudding, it's a skill that gets easier with time.<br /> One may just crack the eggshell and, while not puncturing the yolk at all,hold the yolk in half the shell while the eggwhite slips away by its own weight.  Maybe this skill isn't the same as sinking a three-point shot from way out; nevertheless you might enjoy cooking your own pudding.<br />  Very sorry could not recommend this canned Thankyou product.",0.0
"We have bought these from a variety of sources over the past 2 years.  This bag came and the chicken meatballs seemed to be an odd texture with pink centers and a lot harder than any of the others - we ended up tossing most of the bag.  All in all, our dogs really like these.  We put them in their kongs and it takes a little while for them to get them out.  One of the dogs has figured out if he throws the kong in the air it will bounce and knock the meatball loose.  He gets exercise as well as being entertained for a while. So the 3 stars are for either poor quality control or a bag that sat in storage for way too long.",0.0

"My girlfriend and I picked up a few bottles of the Kombucha Wonder Drink at a local grocery store in Madison, WI. We really liked the idea of the naturally carbonated tea and thought it might be interesting. Well interesting it was, if by ""interesting"" you mean ""makes your mouth pucker with disapproval"". The more I tried to drink it the more I thought to myself that I had almost certainly encountered this flavor before. Then it hit me. I had come across this distinct flavor... during easter while decorating eggs. The flavor of the Essence of Lemon is nearly identical to the flavor of White Vinegar. To test it out I even went to the cupboard and poured a cap of white vinegar and swished it around in my mouth. Yep, thats it right there.<br /><br />It is possible we bought a bad batch. Perhaps self-carbonated teas turn to vinegar if left to long, I'm not sure. I can say that the bottle we drank from looked nothing like the deep yellow fluid on the internet. Our bottle had only the ever so slight hint of yellow, but was otherwise clear as water. If only it tasted more like water and less like that cup of vinegar with colored dye that you dip hardboiled eggs into with a little wire egg holder - maybe I would have given it two stars instead of just one.",0.0
"When I received my package in the mail, eager to try these new pomegranate licorice, I just happened to have a gaggle of people at my home who flocked around me like little birds waiting to be fed. So this review is based on a roundtable discussion which then ensued.<br /><br />I got this candy because I really like Newman's Own products and pomegranate, so I thought I would love these. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them. I am more apt to like the lighter, fresher tasting Red Vine sort of licorice rather than the thick heavier Twizzler kind. These were more like Twizzlers, but tasted more like a fruit roll up. It was also suggested that they taste like the red Vitamin Water.<br /><br />Although I did not enjoy them, there were several in the taste test that did. 4 out of 12 loved them and would buy them again. 2 thought they were so-so and might buy them again. 6 of us didn't care for them. In our numbers were two children who eat every candy imaginable, even fruit roll ups - that these taste the most like, but didn't finish their sticks.<br /><br />All this being said, I like Newman's Own products, will keep buying them and trying new things they bring out. I see that they have a Tangerine version of this same candy and will be buying a pack to try them out!",0.0

"I have a shep/akita mix, but I bought this more for my coonhound, who will eat ANYTHING.  Anything!  Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.<br /><br />Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;)",0.0

"I realized today that I'm not sure what black cherry is supposed to taste like.  I've eaten lots of cherries in my day but I can't remember the last time I had a black cherry.  Now, I enjoy a can of black cherry soda, though, it's one of my favorite summertime picnic beverages.  But I'm willing to bet the flavor I associate with ""black cherry"" is some kind of frankenstein artificial flavoring skidoo unrelated to nature.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry carbonated drink, however, is promoted as ""100% Juice"", no sugar added, and so on.  ""A perfect balance between juice & carbonation"".  130 calories in a skinny 8.3 oz can.  Ingredients: 100% juice defined as: filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I looked up ""acerola"", which is a kind of a (red) cherry.  I guess the ""black"" part of ""black cherry"" is grape and apple and ""natural flavors"". So: drinking this has not solved my ""what's a black cherry REALLY taste like?"" dilemma. Doh!<br /><br />I wonder how much vitamin C they had to add to get to 100% of your RDA, because this drink tastes just a little bit ""vitaminy"".<br /><br />It is, however, a more drinkable, less sickeningly sweet beverage than most of the usually artificially-flavored black cherry sodas I've had.  It's carbonated but I wouldn't call it the ""perfect balance"", it does indeed seem halfway between a cherry soda and a non-descript fruit juice drink.  I never knew I needed that option, but I guess it's nice to know it's out there in a handy little can!",0.0
"Wow.<br />This gingerbread is terrible. Truly terrible. Inedible, even. It's not just because it is sugar-free. Of course sugar-free cake is going to be a little different and less rich. But this is way, way worse than other sugar-free baked goods. I have had sugar-free chocolate cake and loved it. THIS mix is terrible. There are many reasons:<br /><br />- The batter is like a mousse, that just gets hard when it bakes. So it looks like crap because it doesn't smooth out as it bakes. Every spoon-mark is still there when you pull it out of the oven. It looks really weird. You could not serve it to company.<br />- The cooking time on the box (for the loaf pan) is ten minutes too long.<br />- There is no ginger taste, or cinnamon, nutmeg, or spice flavour in this ""ginger"" bread. It is flat and tasteless.<br />- The lack of other flavours allows the nasty aftertaste from the Sweet & Low(tm) to bloom with full force.<br />- The gingerbread is lacking in body, because it is as light and fluffy as a mousse. It is not helpful for dieters because it is not satisfying to eat because when you eat it, you feel like you haven't eaten anything. Strangely, this gingerbread mousse is also rubbery. Rubbery stiff mousse that dissolves in your mouth.<br /><br />The overall experience is like biting into a vaguely sweet sponge. Then it dissolves. And then the bitter chemical aftertaste kicks in.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA how a slice of this gingerbread could be 160 calories. There's nothing in it, it tastes nasty, and it is gross to chew on! You can have a gingerbread Pop Tart(tm) for 200 calories, or a bakery gingerbread cookie for 120 calories, and they are full of fat and sugar.

"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife.

"Hey there retrodog (reviewer) - I use to eat this as a kid too. With mayo or Miracle Whip on white bread or toast. Lots of other great ways to use it too - in deviled eggs, or mixed with horseradish and stuffed into cherry tomatoes (add sliced olives to the top and it's even better). Mix with veggies to make a zingy tasting wrap. I've even known people to put it on their baked potatoes with sour cream. You can spice up mac & cheese with it too.<br /><br />In short: It's relatively cheap (3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), easy to open (pull top lid), and light weight (for back packs, lunch bags, and emergency ""go"" bags.<br /><br />In depth review:<br /><br />It may not be the healthiest item on the store shelves (relatively high in cholesterol and salt), but it is an excellent quick sandwich if you're in a hurry, very cheap (when you get it at a good price) for those who are on tight budgets (you can get 2-3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), it's also a great emergency food to keep in your home, and is also great for emergency ""go"" or ""bug out"" bags. These days, with threats of terrorism and so many natural disasters, an easy to pack, small, light weight source of calories is essential.<br /><br />It's more than 98% meat and fat from chicken and beef, which are 2 things (meat and fat) you want to eat if you're in an emergency situation (no other food available) and need protein and calories to keep you going. This way you're body does not eat its own muscle and fat, so you stay strong and warm until help arrives or you get yourself out of what ever situation you're in. Imagine Eskimos; they ate lots of meat and fat to keep warm in harsh conditions. I'm not saying you want to live on this stuff for months on end, but for a few days or a few weeks, it can save your life - it's cheap, easy to open, light weight emergency calories.<br /><br />Amour's Vienna sausage and sausage bits are also good for the same reason. Keep these, crackers (whole wheat is best), and canned fruit on hand ALWAYS, no matter where you live. Canned beans (any kind) and rice (if you can get moist prepared rice packets) are also good emergency foods. You never know when you might need to stay in for days or weeks at a time with no electricity and no outside contact, or you may need to bug out and live on your own, w/o shopping or going to restaurants for days or weeks.<br /><br />And yes, Amour potted mean is also a great treat for your cat. Although I can't tell if Pauline E. Nordin (reviewer) was attempting sarcasm when referring to cat food, or if she's really had to eat cat food or food that tasted like cat food due to financial distress, but our cats loved it. We use to give it to them once in a while treat when we were kids (50s and 60s). Again, a little too high in cholesterol and salt though (I wish they made a low salt version) so keep it as a once in a while treat only. That goes for you and your cats.<br /><br />What's a good price? You can usually find it on sale; three 3 oz cans for $1.00. At $19.08 for 48 cans that's just under 40 cents per can. Not a bad deal at all if you can't find the 3 for $1 deal near you. And if you belong to Amazon Prime (see PracticalWaysToSaveMoney to find out how to get Amazon Prime for free, we have a special link for Amazon.com related posts) you don't pay for shipping, which saves you money on gas instead of going out to a special store to find that 3 for $1 price. If you live in a very rural area and can't find the 3 for $1 price, or if getting out to shop is difficult for you, we recommend getting this deal at Amazon for sure.<br /><br />Don't need 48 cans? Ask your neighbors to buy in bulk with you. This is always a great way to save. Everyone saves, everyone has emergency food on hand. Win-win.<br /><br />How many cans should you keep on hand for emergencies? We recommend 2 cans for every 3 to 4 people in your household for each week of emergency food you want to keep on hand. For example, if you are a family of 3 and want to keep a 3 week supply of emergency food in the house (three weeks is now recommended by experts), stock 6 cans. That means one can will feed 3 people twice a week for 3 weeks. If there are 4 people in your family, bump it up to 12 cans and you can afford to eat a bit more or feed neighbors if need be (or your cats). You fill in the other meals with other canned emergency food of course.<br /><br />How long to keep? Some cans will show a ""best by"" date on the bottom. Some cans will show a date of manufacture. It depends on what facility is was packaged in. If it has a date of manufacture, according to Amour you're guaranteed good taste for a minimum of 2 years. But knowing this product, we'd say 3 years or more. Most cans with a ""best by"" date will have at least 2 to 3 years before you've come to that date (for example the can I bought this week expires in July 2014), but that doest not mean you can't eat it after that. According to Amour, as long as the can is sealed it's good ""indefinitely"", which is why it's a great emergency preparedness product. WTSHTF I'd eat a 15 year old can of potted mean over bugs any day if I were starving (thinking of those survival shows). But hopefully it will never come to that. And like all emergency preparedness foods, you should rotate on a first in first out basis. Eat the old stock before it gets to it's ""best by"" date and replenish with new stock. That goes for any food.",0.0
"It's true, the lids do leak some when making a coffee, but other than that this product will fit the bill. The lids fit snugly into the tops of used KCups. I do not yet know how many times you can reuse the cup, I am still on the first one.<br /><br />This product has a huge benefit over the mesh screen system sold by Kurig. The mesh screen severely restricts water flow forcing high back pressure on your Kurig coffee system pump. If you use the screen often this will shorten the life of your pot significantly. Back pressure is the slow death of any pump system, from the Kurig to your swimming pool. Reusing KCups solves this problem. Paper filters offer much less resistance to water flow.<br /><br />You also get a fuller, better tasting cup of coffee from the paper filter Kcup versus mesh.<br /><br />One negative, it is a slight pain to clean the Kcups for initial reuse, but not much more than cleaning the screen. After the initial cleaning, it is no harder than the mesh screen.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Extend the life of your pot and get a better cup of coffee. Dump the screen and get the lid!<br /><br />9/3/10 Update: If you want to prevent leakage around the top of your lid, stretch a small piece of Saran Wrap (household kitchen plastic wrap) over the lid, then place it into the filter. Your Keurig will pierce the wrap while the wrap seals the lid in place. No more leaks!",0.0

"Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn salt is wonderful. It is very fine grained<br />and won't just glide across your popcorn and fall to the<br />bottom of the bowl.

This product has barley flour in it so how can it be gluten-free?  I get sick with even a minute amount of gluten in something so barley flour would not work for me.

Surely I am missing something here as to why this product is marketed as gluten-free.  Perhaps the company can explain.  The bars sound really good and I love strawberry.,0.0

"I love their product from Thailand.  I don't like the product from Sri Lanka.<br />The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency.<br />I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie,<br />it will just chunk up anyway.  Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply<br /><br />From the manufacturer:<br />Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut<br />milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in<br />Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we<br />have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our<br />secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different<br />processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has<br />more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees<br />F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates<br />from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by<br />placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then<br />stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,<br />especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,<br />creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While<br />all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool<br />temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced<br />with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut<br />season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies<br />from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all<br />during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced<br />coconut milk<br />as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan<br />sourced product.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joanna Freet<br />Edward & Sons Trading Co., Inc.",0.0

"Brown rice (or ""hulled rice"") is unmilled or partly milled rice, a kind of whole, natural grain. It has a mild nutty flavor, is chewier and more nutritious than white rice, and becomes rancid much more quickly. Any rice, including long-grain, short-grain, or sticky rice, may be eaten as brown rice.<br /><br />In much of Asia, brown rice (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese) is associated with poverty and wartime shortages, and in the past was rarely eaten except by the sick, the elderly and as a cure for constipation. This traditionally denigrated kind of rice is now more expensive than common white rice, partly due to its relatively low supply and difficulty of storage and transport.<br /><br />Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories, carbohydrates, and protein. The main differences between the two forms of rice lie in processing and nutritional content.<br /><br />When only the outermost layer of a grain of rice (the husk) is removed, brown rice is produced. To produce white rice, the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm.<br /><br />Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. A part of these missing nutrients, such as Vitamin B1, Vitamin B3, and iron are sometimes added back into the white rice making it ""enriched"", as food suppliers in the US are required to do by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br /><br />One mineral not added back into white rice is magnesium; one cup (195 grams) of cooked long grain brown rice contains 84 mg of magnesium while one cup of white rice contains 19 mg.<br /><br />When the bran layer is removed to make white rice, the oil in the bran is also removed. Rice bran oil may help lower LDL cholesterol.<br /><br />Among other key sources of nutrition lost are small amounts of fatty acids and fiber.<br /><br />In addition to having greater nutritional value, brown rice is also said to be less constipating than white rice.<br /><br />Brown rice can remain in storage for months under normal conditions, but hermetic storage and freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths.",1.0

"Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse.",0.0

"My husband and I love the Raspberry Quince tea from Republic of Tea and we actually received this as a sample bag when we ordered the Raspberry Quince bottled tea from RoT. I tried it and have to say that it's really good. The hibiscus tea has a hint of berry and citrus, lending it a nice fruity flavor without being overpowering. The natural sweet flavor is a bonus as it means I can have it without adding any sugar or artificial sweetener. This tea can be steeped hot or as iced tea. The tea is also caffeine-free, and the main ingredients are hibiscus (flower), sweet blackberry (leaf), and stevia (leaf). Refreshing and wonderful!",1.0

"Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more ""dry"" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how ""low fat"" or ""low calorie"" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!",0.0

I also love that each bar contains 4 grams of fiber because it can be difficult to find high fiber foods that also taste good. I would eat these bars based on the fiber content alone. The cost seems high to me, but I am not used to buying these types of food. Overall, I would say that the Fruition bar tasted pretty good to a meat eater.",0.0

"I've always been into vitamins and natural health, but haven't jumped on the energy drink bandwagon, even though my dad swears by them. As a naturally high energy person (helped even more by coffee), I figured I might as well give Red Rain Energy Shots a try.<br /><br />It tasted great, with a nice tarty berry flavor, but had some aftertaste. It also worked well. I'm not surprised. Pardon the pun, but it's a perfect storm for energy creation. The ingredient list includes various B-vitamins (especially B-12), Taurine, Tyrosine, etc. These B vitamins and amino acids have been shown to increase alertness, which in my experience, is a different beast than physical energy. The energy component from Red Rain comes from the caffeine. The bottle even says it has the same caffeine as a cup of coffee. Also, the drink is basically calorie free (sweetened with sucralose aka Splenda), a plus since many energy drinks are loaded with calories.<br /><br />I liked this product a lot, but I'm not quite an energy drink convert yet. At the cost of a dollar a bottle, Red Rain is very reasonable by energy drink standards. However, a cup of coffee (brewed at home) costs a few cents and various B supplements bought at an online health food store will set you back a quarter a day at most. But, if your daily Starbucks habit has gotten in the double digits or you just want a quick, easy boost, then Red Rain Energy Shots are ideal.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this product. It tasted great, gave me both energy and mental alertness, and for energy drinks, was priced reasonably. I still prefer my morning coffee and my supplement pills, but if I wanted an energy drink, I'd pick this one.",1.0

"This is the best coffee available for a Keurig machine.  By far, IMHO.<br /><br />Since getting my Keurig brewer I have tested 30+ blends (keeping a spreadsheet with a ranking system of all things), and of all the K-cup varieties that I've tried this blend stands out as by far the best.<br /><br />The coffee is bold and strong, but not at all bitter or overpowering, and it stands up up well to cream and sugar.<br /><br />The flavor is woodsy but smooth and mellow, with a slight hint of citrus and a mild nuttiness.  The balance just works right.<br /><br />Every day I brew this K-cup first thing in the morning and although I love to experiment with new blends, this one consistently tops the charts and every other blend is simply a comparison.<br /><br />One more thing, if you are new to k-cups, please do a little research into the fair trade and organic origins of this coffee and that alone should be enough to make one a dedicated fan.",1.0
"Look, if you are expecting ""real"" bread, or you are a recent change over to a gluten-free diet you will not like this bread. None of the gluten-free ""breads"" taste much like bread, and this is no exception. And, the lack of eggs will make this bread a little crumbly. This is a reality of all breads like this. You have to understand what you are buying. BUT, if you are looking for something to toast for a quick snack, or to use for a sandwhich this is the best gluten-free bread out there. The bread works best if you lightly toast it first and eat it warm. It also works especially well if you cook it with hot toppings. And, if you have a child who just wants to eat a sandwhich like all other kids at school, then this fits the bill. But, bread it ain't. If you are an adult who is new to gluten-free, it will likely taste like school paste. It all is in what you are expecting.

The idea is simple, make a syrup to add to your glass for some delicious tea wherever you are. No messy packets to mess with; No clouds of powder to smell. However, getting it to the right flavor took a lot of shots. The directions say one shot per each 8oz of water. I filled two glasses with 8oz of water.

The second shot smelled like peach but tasted like chlorinated water. The third shot had a wee bit of peach flavor and smelled stronger, but definitely not something you'd want to sit down and sip. The fourth and final shot got a more clear taste of peach but still not strong enough for my liking or my husband's. By the fourth shot and taste test, I decided it wasn't worth trying to add more to get a better flavor. Since each pack is enough liquid for 24 8oz servings (as stated on the packaging), I would say the actual number of glasses of tea you'd get from this using 4 shots each is 6 glasses - 24ozs. A whole lot less than 24 glasses.",0.0

"Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar are delicious! They do not get soggy in milk and have a mildly sweet taste that is not too sugary. The serving size (1 cup of cereal in 1/2 cup of skim milk) is a realistic portion, although I admit to not actually measuring out my serving, but rather eye-balling it. The carbohydrate-to-sugar ratio means that it will not deliver a sugar spike to your system, as is the case with very sugary cereals, and it will stick with you longer. These squares also make a good snack when mixed with hulled sunflower seeds, dried fruit bits, pretzel sticks, and/or some M&Ms -- obviously this will change the nutritional aspects of the cereal, but since you control what does into the snack mix you can make something that suits your own needs. This will be a regular cereal in my house!",1.0
"I had my doubts about growing grass in a package, but this stuff grew like mad.  The cats both ate it cut up in their food.  It doesn't say how much to give them, so it's a guess, unless you ask your vet, but they aren't suppose to eat too much - whatever that would be.  It's been a couple of weeks and the grass is not as healthy green looking so I guess it won't last, but I would say it was worth it.",1.0

"Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo Clean & Fresh comes in an easy to handle bottle with a modern pop-up cap. The Clean and Fresh scent can be spotted on the shelf because the cube on the front is surrounded by blue (as opposed to green for the Cool Fresh Mint scent).<br /><br />Pros:  The product does make a difference in dandruff. Having used the product several times, I see a difference. The Clean & Fresh scent has a more subtle smell than the Cool Fresh Mint even though they are both made with ginseng and tea.  While the traditional whitish color of dandruff shampoo, it feels lighter and more like regular shampoos than a medicated dandruff shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling soft. Note, a very small amount works up a large lather, so the bottle lasts a long time.<br /><br />Small issue:<br />The tilt cap can build up a slight crust that is a bit hard to wipe off because only a small space tilts up, putting it in running water cleans it up easily.<br /><br />I recommend the product for clearing up dandruff with a subtle or no scent left behind. If you like to have a stronger scent of ""clean"" after shampooing you might try the Clean Fresh Mint scent too.",1.0
"Just as with the Original Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan Hot Sauce, this salsa has a unique, addictive flavour.  We've been a salsa family for two decades but have never tasted any salsa at home which has the rounded, authentic flavour that this salsa has.  Is it the cactus?  (An ingredient that we never see here in Canada)  or the tequila?  or a combination with cilantro and spices?  I don't even want to know.  I just want to know that these products will always be available.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you should give this salsa a whirl...don't hesitate.  It's simply the best salsa we've ever tasted.  I'm sure you'll agree.",1.0

I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's breath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly breath was generally a constant).

Even though my wife and I did our best to ration the single bar we bought, it was done inside of a week and we were left with nothing but an empty wrapper and the memory of the most delicious, sumptuous candy with the perfectly sweetened soft nougat scattered with healthy dose of whole pistachios.<br /><br />Inside the outer paper wrapping, each bar is sealed in foil packaging to maintain the delicate softness of the nougat. These are best when you just open them, but are still plenty soft the next day, but I woudn't recommend leaving them exposed to the air for much longer as the nougat will stiffen.<br /><br />After devouring our only bar, we hunted for more at every local shop, Italian or otherwise, to no avail. That's when we found a supplier on Amazon who, after some trouble with shipping, mailed us a box of 6 of these babies almost 3 weeks later.

"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price.

"I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like ""THREE DOG BAKERY"" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it.

"This company makes two versions of its product.  Version one is labeled natural spring water from New Zealand.  This version 1 has a great taste and justifies its cost.  The second version packaged by the same company with the same product name and appearance is ""vaporized water"" with minerals added.  This version 2 tastes like distilled water.  They have identical packaging and only by carefully reading the label can you notice the difference.  This company is very disingenuous to its vendors and customers, as I have gone to Whole Foods to purchase this product and they did not know that there is a difference and mixed the two versions on the shelf.  Typically when you see the name New Zealand on the label you are getting true spring water.  What I received was distilled water even though the picture shows the New Zealand name.  Most of the Eternal water  that you find is the distilled version.  Therefore it is impossible to purchase this product without actually seeing it before you buy.  You must assume that if you are purchasing this product over the internet that you are getting distilled water.",0.0
"Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.

This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid.

Outside of Starbucks cafes and large western style hotels (in all cities, but not in rural India) it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in India.

"Our neighbor has a pool and frequent pool parties during the summer. So we decided to put this in the shower room for a couple weeks, get people's reaction to it, and do our own unofficial product testing.<br /><br />The consensus was the same as my original observation - it feels nice on the scalp, it definitely hydrates and does a nice deep clean. But it's no more effective than Head & Shoulders or any other brand.<br /><br />Most of the people who tested the product had moderate to severe dry scalp issues, ranging from dandruff to psoriasis. Several of them are using a specialized shampoo like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KAA8KK"">Coal Tar Shampoo</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000052XZZ"">Neutrogena T-Gel</a>, or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHE7RO"">Dermarest</a>. None of them (zero) said they would want to switch.<br /><br />Of the people who had moderate scalp issues (i.e., occasional dandruff), they all said this product was nice, but no more effective than Head & Shoulders or even dandruff shampoo from the Dollar Store. Some said this was less effective.<br /><br />I personally like the smell of the product, but it is pretty heavily scented. Several women tested the shampoo, and they all complained about the scent (but hey, it is made for men). A few of the men also said it was too strong.<br /><br />The other common criticism was too many chemicals. On a positive note, the ingredients also contain a variety of nice, natural things: ginseng, tea tree, mint, vitamins b5 and e, almond and coconut oils, etc. It does seem to nourish the hair & scalp, just not as advertised.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",0.0

An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.",0.0

"I love heat on my popcorn and really enjoyed their Habenero microwave popcorn.  In an effor to spice up my own popcorn I got this.

I have been using a mortor to grind it up and then season my popcorn with it as the finer particles actually stick better.  Overall, I will not buy again.",0.0

"While at my friendly neighborhood Uwajimaya, I happened upon this freak of nature: the Komforte Chockolates Ramen Noodle bar.<br /><br />After staring in dull incomprehension for some time, with occasional muttered interjections of ""the hell?"" and ""but WHY?"" and so forth, I bought it and took it home. Really, how could you not?<br /><br />When first opened, the bar looked pretty much like your run-of-the-mill fancy-pants chocolate bar; no sign of eight-for-a-dollar pasta in evidence.  Ah, but when I snapped off a piece, the mysterious amendment was revealed! It appeared to be in the same pre-fried but uncooked form that comes straight from the bag, with which starving students everywhere are intimately familiar.<br /><br />There was nothing left to do but try it. *nosh*<br /><br />The ramen noodles in this chocolate are pretty few and far between, offering more texture than taste; the texture itself is something akin to soft nuts or cornflakes. The shape, size and markings on the bar strongly suggest that Komforte is made and/or owned by the same outfit that makes Seattle Chocolates.<br /><br />The quality of the chocolate itself is pretty good. It's good enough that it could stand on its own without playing up the quirk factor (Komforte's other offbeat chocolate bar flavors include French Toast and Tortilla Lime + Salt), but then they probably wouldn't be able to command premium prices for these chocolate bars. I'll probably try the others just to see what they're like, but I suspect the novelty factor wears off pretty quickly -- and then all you have left to market is an overpriced chocolate bar.<br /><br />(This review was originally published in slightly modified form at the author's blog, Confessions of a Laundry Faerie.)",0.0

"I have always loved chocolate, very milky chocolate. Then I was diagnosed with a cow dairy allergy and thought I had to give up chocolate all together because I could never eat dark chocolate even with a very low percentage of cocoa, like the sugary dark chocolates. I was bold enough to try the 90% as my first dark chocolate bar and while it was way too bitter at first, it only took three squares before I was hooked. I loved the snap while also letting the square melt in my mouth. I started eating half a bar each day for a few weeks until I slowed myself down and had to switch to this 85% but it is still great. I also use it in baking cookies and it works really well. I usually order from whatever seller amazon lists on the product page, but wanted to comment on the direct shipment from amazon. I ordered these bars during 90 degree weather in southern CA and was worried they would arrive melted (couldn't resist, I needed my chocolate fix), but amazon shipped them with two ice packs surrounded by styrofoam at no additional charge. The packs were obviously melted by the time they arrived, but the chocolate was perfectly fine. Thank you amazon :).",1.0

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.

"I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.",0.0

This would be great for someone who gravitates toward a greener, bolder flavor and perhaps a more adventurous experience.  I found it too bitter for my pestos though it worked just fine with roasted chicken, and I think would be great for dipping bread.

"There are legitimate ""earth friendly"" products out there... and then there's a lot of ""hippy fluff"". Unfortunately these bulbs fall into the ""fluff"" category.<br /><br />Sadly, this review could have been totally different, as ONE bulb... OUT OF 12 ordered (2 packs)... met my expectations! ONE bulb looks pretty good... ironically, it was the first bulb I screwed in... and I thought ""yeah, that guy who said these are dim is right, but this is acceptable""... and then I proceeded to add a second bulb to the fixture (ceiling fan)... and that bulb was almost pink in comparison to the first, much brighter, more yellow bulb. Well... to my disappointment... EVERY ONE of the remaining 11 bulbs was that same color (any early adopters to CFL know the color I'm referring to... it's a slightly depressing CFL color that makes you want to RUN, not walk, to the store as fast as you can to buy 40w incandescent Reveal bulbs.)<br /><br />To say that you couldn't read by the light from these bulbs (as another reviewer said) is no understatement... they are about twice as bright as a night-light! There is a less-vocal, yet common ""green is a fad"" attitude... and products like this fuel that view. These are functional for MOOD LIGHTING ONLY... They won't light up a small room (unless you have 6+ of them in a fixture and then it will still be HALF as bright as a 2 x 13w CFL fixture... to clarify 2 x 13 = 26 and 6 x 5 = 30... yet 6 of these will be HALF as bright as 26w of Lowe's Bright Effects CFL) These can barely light up a person sitting at the bottom of a hanging pendant light! (which is what I'll do with the 6 I don't return). Quality dimming CFL is something I've been chasing for years... but it's almost comical to think you'd want to dim these down from their maximum brightness.<br /><br />Just so I can leave you with a positive consideration about this product, if you have hanging pendant lights with artistic glass that you want to light up, but NOT really light up the bar/table under them... (to repeat and emphasize... MOOD LIGHTING ONLY then these will actually work out well... and for THAT use, at about $25 for 6) I could ALMOST recommend these, but if you're buying these because you want significantly usable LIGHT... hmm... I'd have to say ""look elsewhere"".<br /><br />A helpful note to Earthmate... notice where I said ""met my expectations"" about the one bulb... overall... the real problem here is that the product doesn't meet my expectations! Expectations based on claims right on the package. I highly suggest that products like this have wording on the packaging which directs consumers to the most likely REAL use of the product. For starters, these bulbs do NOT replace a 25w incandescent lumen for lumen... probably more like a 13w incandescent... and again, this bulb should work out well for a pendant light, like in a bar... where low lighting is desirable (and further dimming is useful)... and there are several pendants using power (when people have pendant lights they usually have many/several)... and the desire is to maintain MOOD over outright lumens. Claiming an ""18w-20w"" replacement on the box would go a long way to ensuring the bulb in the package meets the expectations created by the package. (I still say these are closer to a 13w incandescent, but having a number in the teens satisfies... meaning ""lowers""... expectations... while having a number in the twenties satisfies the need to ""sell"" the product.)",0.0

As a result, I won't buy any of their whiskeys again. If a company is willing to make a quick buck by sticking their label on an inferior product, it clearly has no commitment to quality. Don't buy these. What a waste of money.",0.0

"I just fostered a dog a few days ago, and he loves this toy.  It definitely keeps him distracted in his grate when I'm either at school or work.  I would however recommend you keep an eye on your dog when he plays with this.  Mine finds it enjoyable to toss across my hardwood floor which creates a lot of noise and can also scratch the flooring.  Ultimately, I would strongly recommend this for all dogs.  Some treats have a filling that is very sticky and can cause the dog to choke, this dose not, and I don't have to worry about his safety when I'm away from him.",1.0
".<br />We were really looking forward to these little chocolate chips!  After all of the praiseful reviews<br />on Amazon, we expected something wonderful.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1.  Tiny-sized chips. Conveniently shaped for baking or snacking.<br />2.  Good expiration date (more than 6 months from now).<br />3.  Manufactured in a dairy-free facility.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  Mediocre in texture and taste. They are waxy, in fact. The flavor is pretty one-dimensional.<br />2.  They don't label how much cacao it contains (in % terms.)  For ex., our preference is 71% content.<br />3.  If you've ever had awesome quality, complex dark chocolate, then you might be disappointed when you taste these.<br />.",0.0

"We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command (""Off,"" ""Wrong,"" ""Leave It"" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say ""Good Girl!"" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there.",1.0

My pods were ""Exotic Floral and Berry"" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.",0.0

"Many people, trying to be and sound more sophisticated, substitute the words ""smoked salmon"" for the word ""lox"".  Having eaten the ""SEA BEAR SMOKED SALMON TRIO"", herein being reviewed, (and the literature that comes with it), I have learnt that, whilst all ""lox"" IS smoked salmon, not all ""smoked salmon"" is lox. (SeaBear DOES offer a nice, large package of ""lox""....and calls it ""lox"", and illustrates it, in the advertising flyer that comes with the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"").  But the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is NOT ""lox"". The fish here is dryish, and very salty.  ""Lox"", on the other hand, must go through additional preparation, for it is far more moist than the dryish fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"".  I have seen, (in the ""Cabelas"" catalogue), ""Lox"" described as 'buttery'....which it truly is.  For those who are interested, ""Lox"" also is usually certified kosher -- whilst the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is not.<br /><br />The smoked salmon within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"", is, as I have said, very dry and salty.  However, all bones have been removed, (although the skin remains).  This fish also will keep on a shelf!  It need NOT be refrigerated until opened.<br /><br />The three types of smoked salmon within have very little taste variation to me.  Yes, there is a TINY bit of difference....but not enough to excite my taste buds.  And salmon -- right from cans, especially the top brands and varieties -- right from the supermarket or on Amazon, taste almost the same to me, at a far lesser price.<br /><br />The literature that comes with this set of three smoked salmon varieties is interesting and informative, as is the history of ""SeaBear"" foods, which is also given.  This company obviously takes great pride in providing good salmon and other products to its customers, and strives to be the best it can be.  I would advise them, however, to emphasize, even more, the difference between ""smoked salmon"" and ""lox"" in ALL its literature, and in the package description of ALL its products. Knowing whether ""Dry"" smoked<br />salmon, or ""buttery"", or ""lox""-type smoked salmon, is in a package, would be a great help to those who, like me, sometimes get their syntax and meanings confused, betwixt the two.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  Will NOT Buy This Product Again.

I did expect salty, I know their original product is salt cured.  But this is a VERY salty product.  If one likes such high amounts of salt (One 2 ounce serving has a bit over 50 percent of the suggested daily salt intake to give an idea) then consider this closer to a four or five star review, the flavor is very nice.  But, and I'll admit I was maybe somewhat naive again it's just a bit too salty for me.  I'll slowly use it up, but I know I very much won't need to add salt if I use a slice of this ham on a sandwich or in a recipe.",0.0

"Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up!

Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in.

They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally.

"The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels.

I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste.

"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.",0.0

"Out of all the Italian espresso I've tried, I think Illy is the best. But how can a regular espresso drinker afford the usual $14/can price? I was ecstatic to find Ferrara decaf because not only is it just as good as Illy, but it's a quarter the price! I love it and am happy to have finally found an affordable way to drink real Italian espresso every day. I've tried Lavazza and although it's fine, it's just not as smooth and delicious as Ferrara or Illy...it tastes cheaper. Finally, I can replicate the coffee I had in Europe! And as for Starbucks espresso and cappucino, just forget it...it just doesn't measure up in terms of taste or price. I recommend a Bialetti Moka pot.",1.0

"I'm fairly new to the world of tea.  I started drinking Dragonwell green tea a couple of years ago when my in-laws brought back some from China.  I started drinking more late last year when someone bought me a Perfect Tea maker from Teavana.  I bought Jasmine pearls at Teavana and found that I really like Jasmine green tea.  Now the teas at Teavana are pricey, good, but pricey.  I bought $30 worth of tea (Jasmine pearl is $12/2oz) and after 2 months, I'm completely out.  I can't compare loose leaf to Jasmine pearl but I can tell you that this tea from Numi comes close.  In fact, the fragrance and flavor are better than Teavana Jasmine pearl.  I love the smoothness of the flavor and the color of the tea when steeped.  The color resembles honey and I can't say I've had better jasmine tea...maybe except at dim sum in San Francisco.  I love this tea and at 2lbs.  I think it should last me for at least 6-8 months.",1.0

"The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.

"While I don't buy 'real' healthy cereals very often, I'm always up for trying new ones. And face it- when there's a cereal called Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, it pretty much tells you that you're in for a good meal. With high expectations...I was right. So right, that I took care of the whole box within a day. No, THAT wasn't a very healthy thing to do, but my god was this cereal great. It looked like some kind of rabbit food when I poured some into a bowl, but upon taking the first bite, I was in love. Crunchy, but not super crunchy. Vanilla, but not super vanilla-y. Sunrise...well, the sun -was- shining when I was eating it!<br /><br />There are only so many things you can say about a food that you like in a review, because the only way if you know you'll like it is by getting some for yourself. Anyone who loves vanilla flavored cereals should like this stuff. It seems like a lot of people here aren't too big on the taste, but I didn't have any problems with it at all. As soon as my first bowl was over, I moonwalked back to the kitchen and poured another. It's a heck of a lot lower in sugar than nearly everything else I get, though I suppose health nuts will always find something to throw a fit about.<br /><br />I was on the fence on giving it 3 or 4 stars because I love the flavor so much, but there's one glaring problem. Someone posted an image above in the Customer Images section, and that's exactly how my cereal was as well. And if you're one of those people that really does go by the Serving Size listed on the size of the box, this stuff isn't going to fill you up very well. When you see how much you're getting by buying a pack of 3 here...for the price, it doesn't seem like a good deal compared to buying 2 bigger boxes of a similar cereal.<br /><br />Problems aside, if you don't mind buying this stuff in bulk, you should be happy.",0.0

"*** Shopping via Amazon as marketplace, I've purchased in bulk out of convenience and my prior satisfaction rate has been 100%, this experience takes it down to 99% *** The specific item review has previously been purchased locally from the many local Asian-markets in San Francisco on many occasions, wanting to make this at home.  Familiarity with, and of product result expectation was set; having also tried the differing levels of ""heat"" to find my preference.  I made one-box using grass-fed, organic ground pork, adding chopped green onions for garnish and added preferential tastes post-cooking.  To my shock and dismay, the finished product had an obvious chemical taste which was undeniable, and putting over rice did not help.  Sadly, though understandably I had to toss the meal - a total loss of time and money committed on all components.  I went out to eat.  Upon return I checked the box to make the expiration had not already been met, something I should have done upon receipt but failed to do, though in the end the date was set at ""March/19/2014"", so that wasn't it.  The next day I tried again but used free-range ground chicken meat and the chemical-taste was still ever present, indicating the mix, not the chicken.  What's up with that taste the was never present before?  Was it the batch?  Was it the way it was handled at some point between manufacturing, warehousing, the vendor, or any of the carriers between those points or later the carrier from whom it arrived literally into my arms?  I cannot say with any certainty.  What I will say, is from this I've learned for myself, that I'll need to continue to shop locally, living in San Francisco I gave up having a car and driving years ago.  That being said I'll make the most of where and when I get to the Asian-markets, believing that they, too, can receive a bad batch but that I'd be the one to have to tell them would be less likely.  In closing, I'd remind you, dear reader, that this was my experience only, and I don't have enough info to fault any point of this transaction.  We live in a world that's come to care less in standards having been previously set for good reasons, standard that are no longer being met to be kept as signs of good faith to ""buy as is"" in the convenience market of products we end up buying to bring a little pleasure into our busy lives.

This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test.

"We had it on bibb lettuce with grape cherry tomatoes. It needed no sauce or adornment. I had seen a recipe that had called for it. It was good, but I don't think that we were any more enthralled with it than we would have been with an Italian tuna packed in olive oil. This would have been close to 1/3 the price of the belly tuna. It was a noble experiment but we woldn't be likely to do it again.",0.0

I don't like to use such dry crunchy treats for training, though, since the dogs need to take a while to chew them and can choke on them a bit if excited.

"I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter. Basically, I would opt for a Dunkin before a Starbucks, just to give you an idea of what I normally drink as I review Marley One Love Coffee.<br /><br />The box contains 15 single serving pods, individually sealed in foil. Each pod contains about 1/3 of an ounce of coffee. They are very convenient for storage or taking on the road. The cardboard box has a cutout near the bottom to easily dispense the pods (or you can just open the box from the top). The coffee is advertised as ""100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.""<br /><br />I typically make my coffee in a Keurig or a standard coffee maker/filter. I tried One Love four ways, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS THE RECOMMENDED USE, as the coffee is advertised as ""for use only in single serve home coffee pod brewers"". Why did I order this coffee without said pod brewer? When I travel I find more and more hotels have pod brewers, so I am interested in a good coffee to use on the road. Anyway, I made the coffee:<br /><br />1) In a single serve brewer, a Black and Decker Brew N Go,<br />2) By filling a Keurig reusable K-Cup/filter.<br />2) In my standard coffee maker, a Braun, using the pods in the same amount/weight as I would any loose coffee.<br />3) Steeping a pod in a coffee mug, approximately 7 1/2 ounces in size.<br /><br />Unlike many coffees, where I think ""Wow that smells really good"", only to be disappointed by the flavor, Marley One Love hit me just the opposite. When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought ""Hmmm, that doesn't smell too great."" But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn't even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all. I found I got the best results using it in the Keuring or regular coffee makers. Steeping it was OK, but it was somewhat weaker that way.<br /><br />I would get this coffee again, either loose in the bag or in pods.",0.0

Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.",0.0

"I like the aroma and flavor of coffee but many brands, particularly the big ""S"" brand, do a job on my stomach.  I was anxious to try Puroast low acid coffee.  I prepared it in a drip coffeemaker.  I was highly disappointed with the brewed coffee.  I don't use sugar in my coffee but this definitely needed it.  The taste and aroma were awful.  It has a burnt flavor, even for a French roast and extremely bitter aftertaste.  The aroma was not particularly inviting either.<br /><br />I wish I still had my PH meter because I would have loved to test the acidity of this coffee vs. regular coffee.  Based on the bitter aftertaste and how it reacted on my stomach, I'd guess it is anything but low acid but I have no scientific means to validate my subjective opinion.  Frankly, even if it is low acid, I can't ""stomach"" the taste.",0.0

"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.",0.0

"For flavor and ease it does get 5 stars from me. I served it tonight as a side dish for two and it was plenty for both of us. Ready in 60 seconds as it proclaims to be. I can see this being very handy for vegans, and for fast lunch-packing where a microwave is available.<br /><br />I am glad I pre-read the other reviews so I took extra care with opening the package, and even so, did spill a little bit. Thank heavens it wasn't hot yet, because most of it went on my hand, as the container the sauce is in is not  secured down, once you pull back the outer cover it is open, the sauce has no film over it, just the outer cover holding it in place. For this reason I hold back a star. I should think there might be a better way to package this. Knowing up front about the possibility of spilling, though, it was not a big problem for me.<br /><br />Both of us really liked the flavor. The tomato/basil sauce provided for the penne was a bit tangy, just like we like it. We do not like the sweeter-based pasta sauces. The penne was al dente, just right, not mushy. Another plus is that they give you enough sauce to cover all the pasta so it isn't dry. We grated fresh Parmesan on it and loved it.<br /><br />This is a good cupboard dish for a fast meal with a salad (you could add cooked meat if you are not a vegan), or seniors that eat smaller portions. You can't beat that it's ready in 60 seconds. Thumbs up on this one.",0.0

"I was quite interested in drinking this coffee after reading the label. I was so interested I spent 1 hour cleaning out my coffee machine to make sure that I was not going to contaminate the taste with any previous beans I had used. I bought this from costco, as far as I can see it was roasted 5 months before I received it. The beans I have received have been over roasted and do not have that super smooth subtle taste, in fact its a little burned with a hint of bitter. I am drinking this coffee as I write this review to make sure its accurate to the taste I am getting.  The coffee I have received does not match the description of ""The best coffee in the world"". If this is as good as it gets I would not bother drinking coffee. Fortunately there is much better. I'm generally disappointed with this batch.<br /><br />In fact I just threw my first cup away and remade it turning the water temperature on my machine to medium (previously high) to give it the fairest possibly chance. No difference.<br /><br />I usually buy my coffee from an outlet that roasts my beans on the day I order them. If you didn't know fresh beans lose their best after 2 weeks unless carefully kept out of sunlight, air, moisture and other strong smelling products as the beans absorb other aromas. This could account for some of the loss of the subtle flavor but does not account for the hint of bitter/over roasting.<br /><br />My advice is buy from a supplier where you know they treated the coffee correctly.",0.0

"We have a 5 month German Shepherd female. This has been the third and best dry food for our dog. The first one Nature's Abundance recommended by the breeder. Although a good quality food, the dog would not eat it, hated the taste even if we added fresh chicken or canned food with gravy. I also think the breeder got some kickback from referring this product. We then tried Innova large breed puppy. The taste was better, but my pup had constant very soft non-formed BM's. After reading reviews about Orijen I thought we'd give it a try. From the very first bite my pup loved it. She will eat the dry food plain, a first for almost any dog I've owned. As recommended we gradually increased the portion of Orijen to the old dry food. When we were at about a 50/50 mix, my pup's BM's started to become formed and more normal. We are finally at 100% of Orijen, no problems noticed, feeding is a breeze, no more finicky eater and the BM's easy to pick up! I think this is a winner.",1.0

"I was pleased to win a sampler box of Brooklyn Bean Roastery's eight most popular varieties (2 of each) in a contest promotion, and I can't say enough wonderful things about this ambitious new company's offerings.  The quality of the coffee is top notch, and the blend variety is mesmerizing.  It's SO good, in fact, that it's really hard to pick favorites, which is why I think that the most brilliant thing Brooklyn Bean did, is offer a VARIETY PACK!  After all, not every one wants the same exact coffee, cup after cup.  Variety is what makes life interesting, does it not?<br /><br />Brooklyn Bridge Blend was the first one I tried, and my personal favorite.  It's a delightful medium roast that delights any time of day or evening, with just the right balance of body and flavor.  If I had to choose one coffee to drink for the rest of my life, THIS would be the one.<br /><br />Breakfast Blend paled in comparison, being a light roasted coffee, but was not a standout for me.  My wife thought it was stellar, and she usually prefers dark, strong roasts.<br /><br />Their Colombian is by far the BEST Colombian I have ever had, very complex in taste with sweet and nutty undertones.  Start your day with this, and you'll have a happy day.<br /><br />French Roast is usually not high on my list, but Brooklyn's is astounding!  It doesn't display the bitterness that I usually find with other French Roasts, and makes an excellent dark roast after dinner coffee.<br /><br />Boardwalk Blend is a medium roast, extra bold, that is best made in a larger size cup, 10 or 12 oz, and is also excellent over ice!  It won't knock you out, because it's not overwhelming in any one character, but it's a pleasant, drinkable blend.<br /><br />Corner Donut Shop is unique, in that it's not like any other company's ""donut shop"" blends for the Keurig type machines.  The flavor is a bit more subtle, and compliments pastries, pies, donuts (of course) any time of day.  This is a relaxing coffee, not one to shake you up, which is a good thing sometimes.  Think of it as the ""comfort food"" of coffees.  Medium roast, extra bold, make this in a larger size cup, also.<br /><br />Cyclone, named for the iconic Coney Island rollercoaster, is a kick in the pants coffee.  Strong, bold, daring and a thrill-ride of complex, intense flavors, circling your palette, with each sip being a new thrill ride.  Yes, you'll want to ride again!  My wife has called this the ""Guinness of coffees"", with chocolaty undertones and full-bodied texture.  Definitely make this in a larger cup, being both a dark roast and an extra bold cup.<br /><br />A Brooklyn uniqueness, Fuhgeddaboudit, is another dark roast extra bold blend that leaves no doubt in your mind that you're drinking a cup of COFFEE!  This will wake you up out of a coma, folks!  Only in New York could they possibly come up with something this brash, cosmopolitan and interesting.<br /><br />In short, we're so fond of Brooklyn Bean coffees, all of them so far, that it really is a tough choice to shop for a single box of any one blend.  This is why you should really try the variety packs!  Keep up the great work, Brooklyn, I predict that this will soon be the #1 K-cup coffee on the planet!",1.0

"I enjoy a variety of nuts for snacks and cooking. This is definitely more the snack-variety.  I liked that the nuts tasted very fresh and had a pleasant aroma when I opened the canister. The canister itself is very convenient and wide enough to reach into for the snack without scraping your knuckles on a rough plastic rim.  The pepper flavor is significant, but not overpowering. A good balance.  However, I like salty snacks, but found this to be a little too salty, even at the risk of drowning out the flavor of the cashew.  If you like VERY salty, these are good, but if you like mildly salty, steer clear.  I can't even imagine how the ones on the bottom of the canister would taste.",0.0
"I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!",1.0

"I was really happy to have these Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried chicken treats when my dog wasn't feeling well and wasn't eating a lot of food.  I broke them into little pieces and gave them to her as a snack.  She likes stuff like this much better when she thinks it is a treat, rather than presenting it as a meal.  I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past, but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat, fruit, and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.  It is quite expensive for the amount offered.  I will probably continue to buy another brand (Stella & Chewy's) freeze dried options because the price, while still high, is much better for the amount of product and my dog seems to like them both the same.",0.0
"The Kellogg's Chocolate Chip ""FiberPlus Antioxidant Bars"" are surprisingly good tasting and are very filling.

They also have 120 Calories and about 2g of Protein.<br /><br />The flavor is a lot better than most of other high fiber snack bars I have tried and these will become one of my regular treats.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

"I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.",0.0

"For those who associate Chia with the green-haired, clay pets, this is something very different - FOOD!  Chia seeds are small and nutty.  They are quite tasty and equally important, packed with nutrition.  High in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, and anti-oxidants, chia seeds are great for you.  Unlike larger seeds, which need to be ground the extract their nutrition (otherwise known as the what goes in, what comes out effect), chia seeds can be added to any food.  They are quite versatile, and can be put in breads, muffins, oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, you name.<br />However, what is unusual about Chia seeds is the texture when added to any liquid (juice, yogurt, etc.  The seeds have an outer later that swells into a chewy gelatinous globule in about 10-15 minutes.  It adds quite a unique and fun mouthfeel to these foods.<br />Chia seeds have many uses, and you will have fun exploring all the different ways to use them in cooking.",1.0

"I recently created a candy buffet for 150+ people for a work event, and 2 items went over extremely poorly.  This was, by far, the worst.  The colors for the candy buffet were red, white, and blue - and these appeared to be white in the picture.  Unfortunately, they were not even close to white.  They were a sickly looking yellowish color instead.<br /><br />Because I didn't have a lot of time and I needed every item I had ordered, I went ahead and put these out (I stuck them in back behind some other stuff).  People still managed to find them, pick them up with disgusted looks, and laugh as they yelled things like ""Who brought the rancid licorice??"" and, ""What the #*$ is this??""  It was an after-hours party, as you can probably guess :)<br /><br />The worst part is that the candy was extremely oily, and even at room temperature, it seemed to ""sweat"" even more oil.

I love cereal and eat a lot of it. I'm not a fan of regular Cheerios as I think the flavor is very bland and cardboard like.

"I was tired of buying the same cereal for months (Chex Cinnamon, whichever Kashi was on sale, and whichever Honey Bunches of Oats were on sale), so I was looking for a new cereal product to try. Seeing as how other reviewers loved this cereal, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />When the cereal arrived, I was excited to give it a taste. I poured myself a bowl of fat free milk and got seated at the table. The cheerios-looking bits certainly looked very good, so I happily took a big spoonful of milk and cereal and delightfully took my first bite. Strangely, I could not taste the cinnamon. On top of that, the cereal left a very unsatisfying aftertaste (was this due to the antioxidants or the fiber?). I struggled to finish my cereal bowl, only managing to finish the bowl by reminding myself of the nutritional value it provided.<br /><br />I would give this cereal a 1-star rating, but considering it does contain a whole lot of fiber, I am bumping this to a 2. Now I am left with the challenge of finishing this box along with 2 others that I have bought. On the plus side, the boxes are smaller than the average Kellogg's/Post cereal found in stores, so I hope I can finish them faster.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, so I'm almost done with the first box with the help of my roommates. They tried it out and said it tasted fine. Then they tried it with milk and said the milk kind of ""washed"" away the taste. The only way I was able to enjoy this cereal with milk was by mixing it with some Kix that I had bought earlier.<br /><br />Edit 2: Done with all 3 boxes. I edited the titled to say that it tasted bland rather than just straight up bad. It's actually not bad at all; it tastes exactly as flavored - Cinnamon Oats. I'm not a big fan of oats, only eating it for its nutritional value, so I wasn't a big fan of this cereal.",0.0

"Highly recommend this brand of coffee for the beginner and seasoned coffee drinker. I dont know how they do it, but these pre-packaged sacks can actually make 2 pots of 8-cup coffee. The flavor is slightly bold, but smooth as ever. I actually dont even like to use cream or sugar with this flavor. You can taste the flavors of butter, rum, coconut right in the cup. Smells incredible as its brewing. However, I personally use a coffee press and the flavor comes through even stronger!! Again, highly recommended, no cons, you will definitely enjoy this over the $6 tourist coffee. Plus this saves you money. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT!!!<br /><br />P.S.

"I was excited to find these on Amazon, and greatly amused by the negative reviews.  Does this jerky taste like dogfood?  I don't know, because I've never had dogfood before.  (har, har.  Sorry couldn't resist.)  Seriously though, not everyone is going to like this jerky.  It doesn't taste ANYTHING like the real stuff, and consequently is a very poor alternative.  However, if you can get past that and see this as a savory chewy snack in it's own right than you may just find that it's pretty tasty.  (Then again, my mom is a total health nut, and I grew up eating things like carob and whole wheat cake, so maybe I'm not the best judge of taste.  haha.)<br /><br />I did have an issue ordering these off Amazon, so maybe that's where some of the negative reviews are coming from.  Nearly every pack I ordered was moldy.  Customer service was great, of course, and I received my refund, but I'd be wary of expired foods if I were to order again.<br /><br />(These snacks are flavored with Bragg's Liquid Aminos which is a condiment used primarily as a soy sauce alternative.  Whatever you put Bragg's in makes it taste like Bragg's.  That's what these taste like.)",1.0

"This product is simply fabulous.  I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.<br /><br />She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.<br /><br />The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are ""everlasting.""  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.<br /><br />Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />For anyone put off by the cost, this product is TOTALLY worth its weight in gold!",0.0
"This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.

It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup.

"I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest ""souper"" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a ""treat"", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for ""my dog loved it"".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.",0.0

"These cookies will surprise you, but only if you take at least 3 bites.

Bite 2 you'll say, ""This is pretty good but not worth importing it from Australia."". By bite 3, you'll be searching for more.  Each of my friends who tried one vowed on their 3rd bite to buy them online or when the holiday season finally brings some to Target.  My coworker tried a Tim Tam slam (bite the ends then suck milk through like a straw before eating it).  She went from not impressed in bite 1 to asking me to help her order enough some from Australia.<br /><br />This isn't a soft or gourmet cookie.  Its similar to the simple joys of an oreo but far more addictive when you reach bite 3.  The closest comparison i can give is BERGER COOKIES from Baltimore which are simple but beyond addictive.",0.0
"I hate chocolate. I used to have this on subscribe and save because the two pack was cheaper than buying the other flavors individually. Unfortunately, the only two pack on subscribe and save was chocolate flavor. I was able to get past the taste despite really wanting to try the other flavors, but there were a few side effects to this particular brand of hemp mix.<br /><br />I would get really irritating tooth aches -- in my gums or teeth -- after I made a shake with this. I've narrowed it down to the inulin or the guar gum. I tried the Manitoba (vanilla) and never experienced an ache. I then tried the super berry version of Nutiva Hemp Shake and my tooth/gum pain returned. Also, I would never ever recommend the super berry flavor; it tastes like flintstones children's vitamins.<br /><br />Three stars go to a not-so-bad flavor. I think someone who actually likes chocolate will enjoy this flavor. However, some of the ingredients clearly gave me a reaction, so I couldn't give this product a full five stars. I think the inulin and guar gum are unnecessary ingredients, but I believe it's what they use to make this mix more 'mixable,' as compared to Manitoba's (which has only three ingredients total) 'sandier' texture. I don't mind the texture of Manitoba's. I don't need a smooth hemp shake, but the texture seems to really bother some other reviewers. If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)<br /><br />**Update 25/10/12<br /><br />I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.<br /><br />ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice -- they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad.",0.0

"This is an excellent high quality cat food at a reasonable price. While it is pricier than your average store cat food, it truly saves you money in the end. I have noticed over 3 months of use that my cats are eating less as they are more satisfied now and getting the nutrients they need. I purchase cat food literally half as often so in the end am spending less than if I was buying a poorer quality food. Also believe it or not, there is far less in the litter boxes now (no doubt due to less processed junk to eliminate and eating less quantity)so in the end I'm saving on litter as well.

However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.

"I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them.  So the ""Fuhgeddabboudit"" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups.  Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning.<br /><br />First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding.  The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds.  I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead?  I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue.  I believe I'm going to contact Amazon about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups.<br /><br />The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control.  There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups.

"I bought these bars because I was looking for a good high protein bar without all the extra junk in it.  Right now I eat Luna Bars for breakfast as wanted something lower in sugar and higher in protein.  These looked like a great buy and, from the glowing reviews, I thought buying a case of them was pretty low risk.<br /><br />Boy was I mistaken.  These bars taste awful.  I eat a lot of natural and organic foods and I have never eaten anything so horrible tasting as these bars.  They have an aftertaste reminiscent of coffee grinds; and have a very heavy sticky texture to them.  They are dry and hard to chew and swallow without getting stuck in your throat.<br /><br />I tried them multiple times hoping that I would like them with time; but I still can't stomach them.  They actually make me feel kind of ill when I eat them.  My husband tried them and so did my son; neither of them could eat more than a bite.  Both of them ended up spitting it out into the trash.<br /><br />I would strongly caution getting a case of these before you try them first.  Given the other glowing reviews of this product, maybe I got a bad batch or something.  But, here I am a tofu and sushi lover, thinking that these vegetarian protein bars are the worst thing ever.<br /><br />My son uses the remaining bars as part of his play food for his kitchen.  The bars are very durable and have withstood many hours of playing; so I guess maybe they have that going for them.",0.0
"My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split.",0.0

"First, I love this brand of powdered buttermilk and I have been baking with it for over 17 years. That being said,...Saco needs to make a better container that will stand up to shipping this item via Amazon.com. The first shipment I received arrived dented so badly that all of the seals were broken and part of the buttermilk powder had escaped into the packing material. The replacement wasn't in much better shape except that thankfully the seals were in tact and none of product had leaked out.<br /><br />Saco powdered buttermilk will harden over time in its original container and so it is best immediately transferred into a sealed glass or plastic container once opened to keep freshest and easiest to work with. I bake a lot of bread and baked goods each week and this brand of buttermilk is always my go-to ingredient that makes a superior tasting loaf/muffins/croissants with a slightly sourdough aroma due to the subtle tartness of the buttermilk.<br /><br />Definitely worth keeping stocked up in the pantry for all of your baking needs!",1.0

"Saffron is unusually difficult to find in my local market so I've been trying out several different varieties available here on Amazon...nothing beats the flavor of Saffron!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one since it is packaged in an acrylic box (unlike Frontier brands which is a competitively priced slightly more expensive version that uses pouches that smell like a pool liner - argh!). The price was suspiciously low so I thought I'd give it a try with the hope of finding an affordable alternative.<br /><br />Unfortunately this simply doesn't measure up even to that of the Frontier brand. While the packaging is STRONGLY preferred...this simply wasn't fresh enough. The flavor was a bit more mild and it required more than double the quantity I've been using for a simple rice dish with the other brand.<br /><br />Notice the expiration date...2017. As of this writing in early 2010 it is good to know the use by date is not near. On the other hand, a seven year window leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Preferred packaging but less fresh than ""other"" brand sold here on Amazon.

"For those of us who drink several bottles of water each day, Vitamin Squeeze adds zest to our lives. One squirt of Vitamin Squeeze will transform your ordinary bottle of water into a yummy vitamin packed tasty drink. The 12 fluid once bottle contains twenty-four (24) squirts, so each bottle goes a long way. One squirt will provide 120% of the USDA daily requirement for Vitamin C and 40% for vitamins B3, B5, B6 & B12. With no calories, sugar or carbohydrates, you get the nutrition and delicious taste without the weight gain.<br /><br />It does contain Red 40 to give it the red color. In my opinion, removing the Red 40 and leaving the drink clear would be an improvement. Also, being that Vitamin Squeeze is a concentrate 24:1, and contains 40 mg of natural caffeine, I would keep it out of reach of small children.",0.0

"I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi-Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie-theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.",0.0

This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect.

"*****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br />*****",1.0

"So I've been trying to lose weight & eat healthier.  I saw these on the Early Show & thought ""wow! Crackers for only 12 calories? This would make the perfect snack to keep me from eating all day!""  The talk show host tried one & was saying how much he liked them so I figured they couldn't be all that bad...well, after tasting them I think he's full of you-know-what!  They are VERY dry & flavorless & not in a good way.<br /><br />I thought they would be a little less tasty than the high fiber crackers at the store, but no...they're way worse, but I guess that should be expected at just 12 calories.  First I tried them with laughing cow blue cheese & the flavors didn't go well at all.  Then I tried them with veggie dip (made with 16oz light sour cream & 1 pack of Cugino's veggie weggie dip mix).  This was at least edible.  I have some PB2 on order to try it with & update my review if it's better.<br /><br />Right now, I wouldn't buy them again, but at least I only paid $6.69 for a 5-pack through Amazon with subscribe & save & a $3 coupon.",0.0

I have never used Gluten free pasta before. I absolutely love this pasta. I enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving. It is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta.

"Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body.",1.0

"And I've tried them all.<br /><br />Maybe its the anchovies. Who in their right mind but these radio clowns John Boy and Billy<br />would put anchovies in barbecue sauce right! Well why not, most all good steak sauces and<br />Worcestershire have anchovies, and you cant make a decent Caesar Salad without them either.<br /><br />What this sauce does to food is amazing. For ribs and chicken it just doesn't get any better.<br />Not a real tomato taste like most mainstream BBQ sauce, and not a mustard flavor either like<br />you will find in Florida and South Carolina. And although JB&B are in North Carolina, its not<br />a traditional NC style sauce either and thank god for that cause NC BBQ is the most overhyped<br />and overrated stuff I've ever had. So they went in a whole new direction with this recipe<br />cause there's nothing else like it.<br /><br />I use it as a finishing sauce on the grill, or you can dilute it with water or vinegar and<br />use it for a marinade, even on steak. Its also great on rotisserie chicken and wings. If you<br />want more heat, get this Hot and Spicy version, its better than the Original Grillin Sauce<br />IMHO. But its not too hot, not going to set anybody on fire.<br /><br />BTW, my favorite recipe is for ribs using Emeril's Rib Rub and John Boy and Billy's Grillin<br />Sauce as a finisher. Great combination. Check the web for other more creative recipes like<br />The Spammer (one can Spam, one bottle Grillin Sauce and an oven) haw haw",1.0

Anyway, I was surprised by its ""kick"".  I could smell the spice the minute I lifted the lid.  A month later, I have grown very fond of it.  You can tone it down by mixing it with a milder cocoa if you feel like it kicks you into the next room...

"If you are an avid Starbuck's coffee drinker, the Natural Fusions coffee is not for you.  Plain and simple.  Now, if you are a Starbuck's drinker and looking for a good 'out the door' coffee that will hold you until you get to your local Starbuck's store, then this coffee is a good choice.  I liken the Starbuck's bagged coffees versus the chain offerings to bottled Coca Cola versus fountain Coca Cola.  The former is fantastic and the latter is just okay.<br /><br />I actually found myself using a few more scoops of the bagged Natural Fusions coffee in an attempt to make it taste more like the original.  I guess if I didn't know how good the real thing was, I would have given this coffee at least 4 stars.  It's good, but not nearly as good as the real thing.

It would be nice if all cookie packages were like this one.  I might have liked the cookies a little more if I could have warmed them, but the kids loved them and they disappeared too quickly for me to get the chance.  I prefer the Chips Ahoy chocolate chunk cookies, so my rating for these would be 3 stars, but the kids would rate them 5 stars.

"Because the grains of teff are small, the bulk of the grain is the bran and germ. This makes teff nutrient dense as the bran and germ are the most nutritious parts of any grain. This grain has a very high calcium content, and contains high levels of phosphorous, iron, copper, aluminum, barium, and thiamin. It is considered to have an excellent amino acid composition, with lysine levels higher than wheat or barley. Teff is high in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. It contains no gluten so it is appropriate for those with gluten intolerance.<br />It bakes like buckwheat, so it is best to mix it with other, lighter, gluten free flours.  I highly recommend it.",1.0

The flavor is pretty good, and I like the fact it has several vitamins (C,B6,B12,E,A).  I don't love that it contains caffeine (but maybe you will).  A lot of the reason, I like these drinks is to change up the water routine without consuming caffeine.  The size of this container is good...much bigger than Mio.  It is overall a good value.  You should know it contains caffeine but if that doesn't bother you, then it is a good product at a good value.",0.0
"This espresso roast didn't knock my socks off with super smoky deep-roasted flavor, but it's the richest I've found so far in the large-bag decaf category.

After making sure I liked it, I signed up for regular delivery at three month intervals. A good value! I am down to the end of my first bag. The five pounds blended with 40% regular French Roast beans from another company lasts two of us about three months. (I think we might be drinking too much coffee!)

Now, imagine that but in lemon. So essentially, if you like wafer cookies, lemon, or the inside of a kit kat you will like these cookies...I think they are soooo yummy, and usually I have 1/2 a pack as a serving and save the rest for later, I recommend storing them in plastic, or wrapped in press n seal though, or they get stale if you just fold over the pack.

"This good maple syrup, in medium amber, the most popular grade.  It's from Vermont, which has slightly more stringent standards about maple syrup density.  Thus I was surprised that this Highland Sugarworks syrup was weaker than the L.L. Bean syrup I was about to run out of.  But reading the label provides a clue to my disappointment.  It's labeled ""Pure NEW ENGLAND Maple Syrup"", as opposed to ""Pure VERMONT Maple Syrup"".  The reverse of the label says ""We also purchase syrup from our friends and neighbors"".  (The L.L. Bean container says ""Packed in Vermont"".)  So I conclude that this is rated on the (weaker) U.S. scale rather than the Vermont scale.<br /><br />It's still good syrup; it just seems a bit ""watered-down"" compared to what I expected.",0.0
"Every spring we get little black ants in the home.  It's like a mini invasion in a couple of locations around the house.  Our first invasion this year came to my bathroom, and it wasn't a huge problem.  I'd squish 30-50 ants per day, and really, my main complaint is that I don't like little insects crawling on my stuff.  They're small, but they aren't clean, and there are lots of 'em!<br /><br />This product stopped the current invasion completely within three days.  When Hot Shot arrived on Wednesday, I placed a two-inch bead of gel along the crack they seemed to be using, wiped up a little residue, and found that the following day I only squished three ants, the next day squished one or two, and today I haven't seen any.<br /><br />The product may not work as well for all types of ant and insect problems, but for my situation, it's been perfect.  I hope the active ingredients are stable, because for my use, the amount of bait provided will last a lifetime.",1.0

"This Tug-a-Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.",0.0

"All other baking cups I've ever used would consistently take part of the muffin when I peeled them off, no matter how carefully I peeled. In frustration I tried silicone muffin trays, which took care of the sticking problem, but left the bottom part of the muffin with a slick, unbrowned surface. These ""If you Care"" baking cups fairly drop off the muffin, and the muffin is left with a nicely browned surface that matches the degree of browning on the top. Two reviewers have complained that these cups are not large. They ARE large, as opposed to small cups. What they are thinking of should probably be termed a jumbo-sized cup.  It's just semantics, although the manufacturer could make it easier on folks by providing dimensions in the specifications. For the record, these cups fit muffin trays with a mean diameter of 2.5"" and height of approximately 1.3"".",1.0

Upon opening this bar the smell was really nice.  I could smell peanuts but no chocolate smell was present.  I really loved the look of the bar, with all the seeds and such.  First bite I loved the texture, alot like the lara bars.  The taste was just so not what I expected, there wasn't any taste at all that I could even compare it to.  All I tasted to be honest was dates, no peanut butter or chocolate at all.  I was so dissapointed in this bar, I had such high hopes and expectations. I gave it two stars because the nutrition is there, but the flavor is not.  At over two bucks a bar at my local health food store, in no way is it worth it no matter how good the nutrition is.

That means that if you were to buy this in this volume, and you are baking for one person, you would never use it up before it went bad.<br /><br />On the flip side, if you are cooking gluten-free for a family, this is a bargain, not for the price, but for the availability:  guar gum can be hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Guar gum itself is a bargain for another reason: guar gum is 1/3 the price of xanthan gum, and yet it's one of the standard binders, xanthan gum and pre-gel starch being the others. (For those of you less familiar with gluten-free baking, you have to have a binder, kind of like an extra required flour, to make up for the lack of gluten.)<br /><br />Finally, hats off to Bob's Red Mill for selling this cheaply and in bulk.  The celiac community is somewhat hostage to vendors who sell what they can eat--and there are those who take advantage of that.  Selling guar gum at this price is another example of Bob's Red Mill having integrity.  Yay!",1.0
"These are very good, but in the very warm weather the filling can go soft.<br />So I keep mine in the freezer.  Try and keep them sealed to avoid moisture -<br />all I do is fold the silver packet over - and they are really good. There<br />is not enough to them to taste cold - but they are crisper.  I only keep<br />the packet I have open in the freezer.  See what you think.",0.0
It appears they don't care how long it takes to deliver.<br />I've been waiting a month so far.  Much more last time and then only after complaining.<br />They don't reply to emails.

"Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.",0.0
"My pet and I love this stuff.  It works great and does not burn like the human version.  Please, do not use the human version on your pets as it burns like crazy.  It does not burn some people but if it burns me I am afraid it would burn a pet.  The human version cost just a little less so some people give it to their pets and it has too much alcohol for a pet.  Pet version is for pets and human is for some humans unless you are sensitive like me then use the human version or the spray.

This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can.

"We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as ""extra bold"" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.",1.0

"This is a great ramen. It contains a vegtable packet along with the soup/seasoning mix.  It is on the spicy side however in my opinion it is not over the top spicy.  Has just enough heat to be noticable and if you drink the broth you will get the full effect of the heat. These packets also make a slightly larger portion than your standard Top Ramen and Maruchan ramens. I nomrally make this with egg whites from two eggs.

"This is a great matcha if you're looking for a refreshing flavor.  It's a bit like apple juice actually, only it tastes healthier in a good way.  :)  The matcha is vibrant and light and the apple is more like a combination of real apple and candy apple.  Quite nice.  There is something a bit off with the flavoring.  It has a bit of chemical flavor, but it is not too bad.  I still enjoyed this.",0.0
"I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to ""get the treat"" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, ""THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!"" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing.

"Fennel seed is a very versatile spice, whether you use it in whole seed form, or ground.  These seeds have very good, strong sweet and savory flavors, and I have used them successfully for making rye breads, italian sausage, both Mediterranean and Italian seasonings, and in ground form as a component of Chinese Five Spice.  It can also be beneficial for digestion and congestion when used in tea.<br /><br />I've gotten the most mileage out of these seeds by making my own homemade italian sausage (ground beef or pork, minced garlic, fennel seed, salt, pepper, and paprika or crushed red pepper, depending on how much heat you want), as store bought Italian sausage is nearly 2x the cost per pound, compared with ground pork or ground beef.  Save money and make Italian sausage yourself!  Also, don't bother paying $4 for less than an ounce of this spice at a grocery store, as you can get two whole pounds of great quality stuff here for under $10!<br /><br />Haven't attempted to grow these seeds, but will report back if successful.",1.0

"I've made it a mission to find a plush dog toy that will last for more than a day or two.  I became very excited when I read the description for this dog toy - layers and layers of material and rows upon rows of stitching.  My dog is not a chewer, but he does like to shake his toys while he's playing with them.  This one lasted less than 10 minutes before his front canine tooth went right through one of the legs.  It was all over after that.  I have to say though, the stitching does seem to be very good around the edges and if you have a dog that likes to chew the arms and legs, ears and noses off of his toys, this may hold up for a little while.  However, when a company uses words like 'extreme durability' and 'world's tuffest dog toy', I base my purchases on those descriptions- especially when buying on the Internet.

Big let down, not bad, but not knock my socks off great either.<br />The 'fruit thins' did have nice bits of fig/fruit in it, but they were too sticky. While nice in taste the fruit bits just didn't contrast well with the thin crispy cracker texture.<br />I will probably serve the rest of these with, say, tea.

"I must confess that I ordered this product thinking that it was simply a box of chocolates without realizing that it was chocolate flavored coffee, but don't depart this review just on account of this confession. I gave this item to my daughter who enjoys flavored coffee (it's just not my cup of tea!) and she has reported to me that the taste is really quite wonderful. It has both a full-bodied coffee flavor, which we would associate with Gevalia and the chocolate - truffle tastes were 'merged' beautifully creating one special and unique coffee experience. So if I may pound this comic metaphor into this review one more time, if flavored coffee is your cup of tea and you like mocha-like flavors, then this just might be the perfect gift to yourself or to someone who also craves mocha any time of day.<br />So why the four stars instead of five?

I absolutely cannot believe something with such a subtle, delicate flavor could come out of a packet and is ready in a minute! This over white rice is the ultimate Indian comfort food. And the best part is that it's vegan, high in protein and fiber, and all-natural.",1.0
"When they are fresh they can not be beat. When they are a little past their prime they are still very good. They have a strong mint presence and it leaves the mouth feeling somewhat refreshed and with a minty taste. Do not know if they could alternatively help with the occasional bad breath problem that afflicts anyone at one time or the other. They certainly feel strong enough to convey security in that department and if Mentos wanted to corner the market they should make sure it can also combat the annoying and always irritating (to the ones in the other end) episodes of an unkempt mouth, which is not to say that in some cases is unavoidable and soon enough remedied by the conscientious bearer.<br />Mentos Mint Candy, 1.32 Ounce Rolls (Pack of 30) was the best deal in terms of quantity versus value. What at first might appear as over doing it in the numbers ends up being just right. Enough to say that the fresher the shipment the better because that is the time when the flavor is at its peak. This is the one flavor by mentos that delivers a flavor full of fresh mint and it last right until it is gone. Imagine, if only for a minute, if besides helping to kill the germs that cause bad breath they could also be healthy to the teeth by adding Xylitol which has been proven to greatly reduce cavities and preserve teeth in general. I am probably dreaming but I see Mentos Mint like powerhouses in their own right.<br />4.5 Stars for these mints!",0.0

"I like Fig Newtons, and Newtons in general. I also like honey. So it goes without saying that I wanted to try these. Newtons are always a healthy alternative to other types of cookies and snacks, so I was hopeful these would be the same.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />These cookies are very crisp, they are flaky but not soft. They hold their shape very well, and surprisingly, even after shipping, only a few were broken in the package. There are about 30 cookies in s single 10.5 ounce package.<br /><br />In terms of consistency, I'm very pleased. They remind me of shortbread. Each cookie is about 2.5 inches in diameter, so they are a decent size.<br /><br />There are three cookies in a serving, and the serving totals 140 calories. Personally, three is a bit much, so I keep it to two. However, in a regular serving, there is 5g of fat, 2g of fiber, and only 7g of sugar. The sugar content is really low, making for a good healthy alternative.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the figs are a bit chewy and hard in the cookie. This may immediately turn you off from having more, since it takes a little more effort to chew than a Newton. It could also be the honey combined with the fig pieces that makes them a little tough. Also, I've come across one fig pit piece in a cookie...so you need to watch your teeth. In other words, you just need to be mindful of this while eating the cookies (and the same holds true for Newtons, too).<br /><br />I like these enough to buy them again in the future. They are delicious, hearty, and healthy. Other than watching for a rare pit, I highly recommend them.",0.0

"I tried 3 flavors (Cherry Berry, Orchard Blend and Tropical Blend) and found the following to be true of all of them.<br /><br />1) Packaging is impressive with long, narrow, foil lined one-serving sized bags. However, the size of the bag is deceiving for the amount of product inside. Although they are easy to open by simply tearing off the top inch, they are not resealable - not that you would want to because the servings are so 'small'. The bag design also makes it near to impossible to reach in by hand for snacks. Even a child's hand is too large, resulting in having to eat this snack by pouring into hand or bowl.<br /><br />2) At the bottom of each bag is a layer of fine 'powder' residue from the dried fruits. It gets on everything and stains: esp. when wet from fingers, etc. It also makes it difficult to get the last of the snacks from the bag to your mouth, esp. if eating directly from the package,  because the powder from the bottom of the bag puffs out, up your nose and all over your mouth. Makes a mess.<br /><br />3) All 3 flavors that I tried had the same issue as someone mentioned in their comments before me: each flavor seems to have an over-abundance of one particular fruit. In the Cherry Berry, it is apples. In the tropical, I found it to be mangoes, and in the orchard, it was bananas, lots and lots of bananas.<br /><br />4) I also found some of the snack to be 'crunchy' while other pieces of fruit were sticky/mushy once in my mouth. Ex. banana slices. The combo of moosh and crunch (very little crunch) was disappointing when this is suppose to be a 'crunchy snack'. I found myself using it up in yogurt and oatmeal rather than as a snack.<br /><br />This is a natural snack so the first time around I didn't mind the expense. However, now that I know what to expect, I will not purchase again unless the packaging and fruit 'dust' issues could be addressed. Then it might be worth the money. Until then, I'll buy my own fresh bananas, mangoes and apples.<br /><br />I will admit, however, a few of these put together in a gift basket would make a nice presentation for someone who has never tried this product.",0.0

"So despite this saying low-glycemic, it actually does have sugar, though much less than other brands (5g per serving). It is also mostly gluten (wheat gluten) free.  The grains are oats, quinoa, amaranth, millet, and buckwheat. The flavor is mild and tastes more natural than other brands, none of that super artificial flavor. It is great on yogurt (I use plain soy yogurt and add real fruit, granola, and a dash of chia seed).  It is also great in almond milk as a cereal (again, I'm vegan here).  It's tasty as a snack.

"I love these fruit snacks!  My duaghter loves them as well, but I wasn't expecting to like them.  They have a great texture, chewy but soft.

"I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.<br /><br />The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this.

"The fact that you are reading this review indicates that you are interested in olive oils that are a cut above the olive oil you are likely to find at a supermarket or a corner grocery store (unless you live in an Italian neighborhood).  You probably know, then, that olive trees do not tolerate frost well, so European olive oils come from southern Europe, from near the Mediterranean Sea, where frosts are infrequent.  You probably also know that the most highly regarded oils come from just south of the frost line, in the northern parts of that olive-growing region.  Finally, you know that top-level Italian olive oils fall into two distinct classes, the light Ligurian oils from near Genoa and the Italian Riviera, and the stronger peppery-finish oils from near Firenze and Perugia, in Tuscany and Umbria.  Within the latter group, some Umbrian oils are especially highly regarded, and the Italian government has established a D.O.P (protected geographical designation), ""DOP Umbria,"" for Umbrian oils that meet the certification criteria.  All DOP Umbria olive oils are good:  there, I've said it.<br /><br />WITHIN the DOP Umbria designation, however, there are further subregions.  Many of us regard the olive oils from ""Colli Assisi-Spoleto"" to be the best of the DOP Umbria oils.  As its name suggests, the Colli Assisi-Spoleto subregion comprises olive groves growing along the lower slopes of the Apennines between Assisi in the north and Spoleto in the south, which is a fairly limited area; and the very heart of that area is the even smaller region close to the towns of Trevi and Foligno.  Some of the oldest known still-producing olive trees in the world grow in that area.  In fact, centuries ago, when the area was part of the Papal States, ruled by the Vatican, olive oil from Trevi was destined to go only to the Vatican; the Popes of that time wanted the best oil for themselves.<br /><br />Just as wine grapes have varietals:  cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, etc., so do olives have cultivars.  In Tuscany and Umbria, most of the great olive oils come from three cultivars in particular:  Frantoio, Leccino, and Moraiolo.  Trampetti groves comprise all three cultivars.  However, as palates worldwide have become more sophisticated, demand has grown for 100% Moraiolo olive oils, and Trampetti makes a superb one:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YO8P6I"">Trampetti Umbrian Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17 oz</a>.  By diverting its Moraiolo olives to 100% Moraiolo extra virgin olive oil, Trampetti can get a higher price for that oil by itself that it can get for the same oil included within a blended cultivar product.<br /><br />But that leaves Trampetti's Frantoio and Lecino olives behind, and the importer of Trampetti olive oils, Ritrovo, has been the beneficiary.  Ritrovo imports a Trampetti oil that is made from Trampetti's Frantoio and Leccino cultivar olives, and that is the oil under review here.  The Trampetti olive groves are located right between Trevi and Foligno, in the very heart of the heart of the DOP Umbria region; but the Trampetti-produced olive oil under review does NOT have the ""DOP Umbria"" certification on its label; I do not know why.  However, this oil does have all of the taste of a top flight DOP Umbria oil.<br /><br />Now, before you get the idea that a Moraiolo-less oil is shabby, be aware that some of the most highly regarded Tuscan -- and Umbrian, including DOP Umbria-certified -- olive oils are made from Frantoio and Leccino olives.  Frantoio and Leccino olives can be the basis for GREAT olive oils.  These are oils that you dip freshly baked bread into to savor the oil's taste almost by itself.  These are oils that -- even without any other ingredients -- can transform a few leaves of fresh spinach into a wonderful salad.  We have seen friends drink these oils straight from a demitasse; they are that good (but if you try it be prepared for the peppery finish in the back of your nose).<br /><br />Among all of the top tier Italian extra virgin olive oils, the Ritrovo (Trampetti) Frantoio/Leccino extra virgin olive oil may be the best bargain.  For instance, if you compare this Ritrovo oil to the first class and excellent <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QCU9R8"">Capezzana Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2010 Harvest 100% Italian 500 ml Bottle</a>, you may find that you actually prefer the Ritrovo to the Capezzana; while it is equally true that you may prefer the Capezzana to the Ritrovo, the two oils very much play in the same league, and your preference either way cannot be sneered at:  degustibus non disputandum est.  But between these two very competitive first-tier olive oils, the Ritrovo is far more economically priced than the Capezzana.<br /><br />But take this as a warning to your pocketbook:  Once you have this Ritrovo olive oil in your kitchen, your consumption of olive oil quite likely will spike; you will start putting this oil on and in everything.  You probably will consume a lot more olive oil with the Ritrovo oil in your kitchen than you ever have done before.  You have been warned!",0.0

Since each animal has their own smell, then this product is more likely to keep your pet from going anywhere near it.<br /><br />For this to actually work, the pheromones would have to be equivalent to that of your pet(s) and in high enough concentration for them to be drawn to it.  Like when a dog continuously pees in the same spot/area when you take them out on a walk (given that it is the same path).  Also, the same reason puppy pads (newspaper) and cat litter boxes work for training.  Plus, why you have to put a heavy duty odor eliminator on top of a spot that you have just cleaned when your pet makes a ""mistake"".  If you don't, then they will continue to go to that spot.<br /><br />Suggestion: If you really want your dog to go in just one place your best bet would be to collect your own dogs pee (don't forget to buy rubber gloves, a RubberMaid container w/ a lid, and possibly a face mask for the smell). Then soak some wooden stakes in it for a few days - the longer, the more the stakes will absorb, but watch that the stakes don't start to become too moist - w/ the lid on tight. After a few days, stake them in the spot you want your dog to use.  They will be attracted to the high concentration of their own scent and you shouldn't have to do it any more b/c they will go in that spot from then on.",0.0
"These lamps were at first look very good & bright as well as energy efficient<br />(I remember my old man would only use 25w light bulbs when we were kids as ""they saved energy and money"" - little did I know he was predicting a future path we needed to take so the hole in the ozone layer wasn't bigger than Australia)<br />Unfortunately I bought these for the purpose of using them in dimmable fixtures - to allow situation lighting as well as energy efficiency and reducing my carbon footprint.

A close friend of mine at work from Cambodia brought in a bag of Wasabi Peas. It didn't take long for me to get addicted to them. If you like horseradish you are going to love these wasabi peas.

"Let me start this review by saying that I ***LOVE*** my Keurig machine! I can get a great cup of coffee, any strength, any brew, any boldness, any flavor, without brewing up a whole pot. It is a brilliant concept for coffee, which has always lent itself to either mass-brewing or pathetic ""instant-coffee"".<br /><br />Tea and cocoa, however, typically cost anywhere from $1-$4 per box of 20-30 bags/packets. Tea and cocoa are inherantly single-shot items to begin with, so the idea of paying $10-14 for a box of 24 tea or cocoa K-cups is ludicrous. It offers no real extra convenience and costs about ten times the price. It would be like buying a Kia Rio for $8,000 or a Daewoo Leganza for $80,000... they are both basically the same car, so why pay ten times more for one? It just makes no sense.<br /><br />On a side note, I also have found that this cocoa is a bit watery at times and doesn't even hold up to a packet of Swiss Miss and some hot water.",0.0

The smell of the tea reminds me of black licorice and fresh mowed grass - a nauseating combination for me, not pleasant.  Since this tea has garnered so many great reviews, maybe it is just my taster.  Also, I have never tasted any other Darjeeling teas other than this one by Twinnings to compare, so maybe I just don't like Darjeeling tea.

"For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener.

"I was looking for a couple items to add some fiber into my new diet.  This was one of the cereals that I bought.  Obviously we all have different tastes and like different textures......but Holy Moly does this taste good to me.  Darn near too good.  I love cinnamon and have liked the taste of apple cinnamon cheerios.  This is without the apple, but the cinnamon is on blast.  I almost wish they would cut the sugar from 7 grams down to 3 grams and make it even better for you.<br /><br />One person mentioned texture.  I found the texture to be like cinnamon toast.  I didn't notice 'gritty'.  Gritty implies something unatural, where as this just seems to have the right crunch.  Don't let it sit in the milk to long or it will get soggy like any of the O's .<br /><br />I've actually did a 50/50 mix with cherrios to lower the sweetness and calories/sugar a bit.  I eat 2 servings to make one bowl.  I think this would be a good snack too.  Alot better than crackers.  And maybe better as a snack then a breakfast, because it's taste too darn good.<br /><br />I wish they made a bigger box so one can get a better price.<br /><br />I give it a full and complete 4 stars and recommend you try it.",0.0

"I've tried all of Sodastream's regular sodamix flavors, and they're made with artificial sweeteners so I don't think they taste very good.<br /><br />This flavor (natural cola) is quite good. It doesn't have any artificial sweetener taste, and it has a nice cola flavor. Now, it definitely doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi. I'd describe it as a fruitier Coke, provided that you use slightly less than the recommended portion to make the drink. And I think that's something worth mentioning: you can vary the level of sweetness by slightly altering how much of the mix you pour in to the bottle of carbonated water.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this flavor, I would definitely buy it again.",0.0
"Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars are delicious and are my treat of choice when serving my grandchildren, instead of other snacks without any nutritional value. The Oats 'N Honey version seems to work best for those under 5 years old, as there are no nuts, which, for some reason, offends my 4 year old granddaughter (she will eat around pieces of almond and the like!). Perhaps it is just something difficult for her to chew.<br /><br />Yes, these bars do contain some processed sugar, however, they are definitely a healthier alternative to cookies, cakes, and rice crispies treats.

"The output of Green Mountain Cocoa K-cups is highly variable - sometimes it's a well-flavored cup of cocoa, sometimes it's just brown water.<br /><br />This is because sometimes, a significant amount of the cocoa powder stays behind in the cup after the brew cycle. To really get a consistent product, you have to pierce the foil top to see if there is stuff left behind; scoop it out and stir it in, and you get the well-flavored cocoa some reviewers are raving about.<br /><br />This, however, is ludicrous - it defeats the fire-and-forget interaction that makes the Keurig worth it.<br /><br />The only thing that saves the product from a 1-star review is that its quick sugar hit has prevented many an afternoon nap at work. :D",0.0

"It's funny that most of the other reviews talk about using it straight, when I've never used it that way or even thought to try using it as shoyu! I use it as a soup base for zaru soba, somen salad, and udon. We mostly use it for hot udon. You basically put different amounts of water for whatever noodle you're eating and it tastes amazing each time. For instance, udon uses 1 part memmi, 12 parts water. It's extremely simple and tastes soooo good. Me and my daughter always drink the soup after and I make extra now so that we can have a lot of soup to drink with each noodle! This is really an amazingly good sauce! I'm hoping they eventually add subscribe and save for it.",1.0

"Another reviewer remarked that the bottle was leaking when it arrived.  Same with mine.  And it's a bad package design.  I don't know what other guys do with their shower products, but I have a shelf in my shower that shampoo bottles and the rest go on, and this is entirely too tall and top-heavy of a bottle not to fall over in that environment.  I do appreciate the one-handed snap-open lid, but it needs to be on a much squatter bottle to prevent frequent falls.  I would guess it's too tall for most caddies and is not a good fit for gym bags, either.<br /><br />So having attacked the packaging, I found the scent to be pleasant and just this side of too much.  I expected an herbal smell, which can range from subtle and welcome to overpowering and obnoxious.  With mint and green tea essences fighting it out in the formula, the smell could have been awful.  But no, it's not that obtrusive and results in a sense of freshness rather than having been heavily perfumed.<br /><br />The conditioner works quite well.  Because my hair can become oily over the course of a day or two, I favor shampoos that are good at removing oils, but the unfortunate side-effect is that stripped hair can become damaged, fly-away, and lifeless.  The conditioner in Clear Men is light enough to avoid adding to my greasy head woes, but present enough to add a little body and manageability.<br /><br />I am highly doubtful that the herbs used--or indeed, any herbs--are as effective a treatment for dandruff as several non-organic compounds (notably those with sulfur and zinc compounds) are, but I do not have much of a dandruff problem to start with and generally only choose dandruff compounds as a preventative.  I don't know but suspect that men with really serious dandruff issues are not going to be satisfied with the treatment afforded by largely herbal therapies.  ""Clear Men,"" however, does contain a zinc compound that I suspect does all the anti-dandruff heavy lifting, with the botanicals merely added for cache and marketing appeal.<br /><br />Having said that, and setting aside the horrible packaging, it's a perfectly acceptable shampoo and I can see myself getting it again sometime--more likely if they come up with a bottle that is less like a carrot and more like a pumpkin.",0.0

"We've  been buying Happy Tot Organic Superfood pouches (Spinach, Mango and Pear) for almost a year now.  The kids love them as a quick on-the-go snack.  When they were temporarily out-of-stock, I decided to buy this, with the assumption that it would be of the same caliber as HappyTots.  Not all pouches are alike.  Happy Tots tells the consumer right on the front of the pouch which ingredients are inside - spinach, mango, pear and salba (chia seeds).  When you look at the ingredient list on the back of the pouch, you see the organic ingredients of pear, mango, spinach and salba (chia seeds).  No added water, no added apple puree.  Plums Organics not only added apple puree and water to their pouches, but those are the first two ingredients.  Normally, I check the ingredients list prior to purchasing a product, but since this was online and I had such a good experience with Happy Tots, I didn't do that.  I'll be more prudent next time.",0.0

"I ate a Berry SoyJoy bar the other night, and it wasn't that good.  It had an odd taste.  I have had other SoyJoy bars before, so the dense and dry texture wasn't an issue.<br /><br />The berries used aren't your typical strawberries or blueberries, but rather hawthorn berries and wolfberries (goji).  I don't think they carried that much flavor into the bar, though, because it didn't taste that fruity.  And despite the high sugar content (12g in a 30g bar) it didn't taste that sweet to me.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy a whole box unless you've tried it before and liked it.  Get a single first because it really is an odd taste and I disliked it.<br /><br />I can say the ingredients are good as far as nothing artificial, so that's always a plus.",0.0

"As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.

"What a worry-wart, the reviewer concerned about the plastic bottles.  The product is in plastic so it can be squeezed onto foods.  Seriously - now we've got to worry about any food packaged in plastic in addition to everything else?  OK, rant over.  If you can overlook the horrors of the packaging *shudder*, then prepare yourself to delight in a wonderful, versatile, VERY shelf stable and delicious product.<br />Does it have the complexity of very old, aged, syrupy balsamic that costs well over $100/bottle?  Not quite, but for 10 bucks a bottle, it's a hell of a deal and sure to impress any guest.  I LOVE it drizzled over my homemade pizza, especially on top of prosciutto, figs, carmelised onions, etc.  I put it on after cooking.  It's ok for dipping, but personally I find it a little thick for this.  Salads, YAY!  bruschetta, YAY!  Sandwiches?  YAY!!!  Excellent product.

"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.

"I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.",0.0
"This is a very high quality product, which can be used in many things, from smoothies, to Raw desserts, or even as a very nutritious satisfying snack. I noticed that people had noted the horrible taste, etc... You have to be prepared for the fact that real Cacao is not sweetened, and can be rather bitter. However, if you want to get the full benefit from Cacao then this is the best form to get it in. As processed Cacao, loses much of its nutritional benefits. I would suggest mixing the Cacao nibs with a natural sweetener such as Raw Agave, to make more palatable, etc... Although, I think they are very good by themselves. To your health, and well being.

"I saw all the negative reviews but decided to try this bread anyway.  When you first get it, it looks great.  It's soft and smells good.  It behaves as slightly thicker white bread.  However, once you go to eat it, the problems begin.  It absorbs all moisture in your mouth and is so tough that it's like eating meat.  You can hardly tear the crust with your teeth, and then you end up with what feels like a sponge in your mouth.  It takes forever to chew it, the whole time it's tasting worse and worse.  When you finally swallow it, it's like you ate a cue ball.  I had to drink water while chewing multiple times just to keep from choking.<br />I would definitely not recommend this bread, and instead would recommend one of the Health Express breads.  I got both on the same shipment and it was definitely the winner compared to this bread.",0.0

"I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!",0.0

"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.",0.0
"I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really ""spicy"", they're more like mild in my opinion.

It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.",0.0
"I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.",0.0
"The ""butter flavored"" popcorn topping is ok. Is it worth the 14g fat/tablespoon?  Probably not....  It really doesn't have much flavor to it.  If you don't have salt in mass quantities, the popcorn is going to taste oily and bland.  I would recommend using just coconut oil.",0.0

"Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.<br /><br />If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other ""luxury"" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).<br /><br />EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?). She is really becoming quite beautiful.",1.0

"I was guessing, when I ordered this item--no item description was provided.  From the tag, I thought these snacks might be highly processed--but they aren't.  They are shelled green peas, cooked in coconut oil, lightly salted, and dried.  I find them a bit too solid, as is, for compatibility with my own expensive dental work.  Therefore, I grind them up in a blender before adding them to instant soups, or cook them whole with stews, etc.  They contain a bit of bright green food coloring, which I find more attractive in cooked products than the (less expensive) dried green split peas commonly available in grocery stores.  I expect them to store longer if refrigerated or frozen than if left at room temperature.",0.0

"Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).",0.0

This is ONLY tuna, nothing added.  When you open the can (with an easy pull-top), you use all of the tuna and the juices, it's really delicious.  I am a big tuna eater and this is excellent tuna at an affordable price.  Upon opening the can you will notice a whole piece of tuna, never flakes or chuncks, and you can break this tuna 'steak' apart depending on how big of chunks you want, or leave it whole on your plate.  No matter how you use it, it's really good eating.  It's moist and has a big flavor, an excellent choice for your tuna sandwiches or salads.  I stocked up on about 10 orders so my pantry will be full and I can eat this to my heart's content...and what a healthy heart it will be with the high levels of Omega 3!

"Some people find it ""bitter"", I read. BITTER? No,no, delightfully complex is a far more accurate term.  Think not-so-sweet root beer mixed with orange or lemon peel.  If you want soda to taste like candy, this is not for you. But bitter it is not. It is very reminiscent of Campari, Cynar, or Fernet Branca.  Think angostura bitters with a bit of sugar and mineral water.  Try it!  There is nothing else like it.",1.0
"As a big fan of Arnold Palmers, half lemonade half iced tea over ice, I'm pleased with this K-Cup variety.  I add a bit of sugar after brewing it over a big cup filled with ice, and its a great alternative to soda or trying to mix an Arnold Palmer myself at home.",0.0
"Whenever I play with my cat my hands are always getting scratched. This glove  is a heavy canvas with long fingers so when the cat grabs at them your own hands receive minimal damage. There is a long spine (maybe plastic) in each finger which keeps each finger straight and the toys are actually attached with a retracting elastic cord so the cat can grab the toy, pull it out and chew on it, and then the toy snaps back to the finger tip. I've seen that the toys are replaceable too so when they get worn out (or eaten up) you can get new ones. I have a few toys by Fat Cat and they hold up well to play and washing, and I enjoy the color. Amazon has the best price and if you have Prime you don't pay shipping.",1.0
Was impressed with the flavor so I subscribed.  Second bag was excellent too. But the third and last bag I received 09/21/12 EXP date has an off taste. Not sure I can stand to use up the whole 33 oz. So I give this an inconsistent very good to poor quality. I cancelled the subscription. Price also went up after first subscribed bag was delivered.,0.0

"Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water.

"UPDATE APRIL 2012: Awhile back, some Amazon customers were having a problem with the product they received.  I believe that Amazon packaging sorted out the issue. Now when I receive these from Amazon, they are always fresh and in sealed packaging. Each box is individually sealed tightly in plastic wrap.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />These bars are very good, kind of like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They taste so good that they have taken their place as my new favorite protein bar by thinkThin. They taste like chocolate and peanut butter.<br /><br />However, I should clarify that the chocolate is sort of a diet tasting chocolate. The ingredients are natural, but it is diet. It is good for a diet protein bar. It may taste a little bit dry compared to some protein bars that are loaded with sugar. There are some brands of protein bars out there that, if you read the labels, contain a lot more sugar. If you want a bar like that, then this may not be the bar for you. It tastes pretty good for the type of bar that it is: very low sugar and low fat.<br /><br />They are less sweet than other brands of protein bars, because the bars by thinkThin contain lower amounts of sugar.  However, they are healthier, so for me, it is a good trade-off. Also, if you are used to other brands of protein bars, they may not taste as rich. If one looks at the ingredient label of the other brand versus this brand, one may see a lot more sugar in the other brand.<br /><br />Note for hypogylcemics: For hypoglycemics like me, at first glance this bar appears to have 0 gms of sugar, which would help to stabilize the blood sugar. Combine that with 20 grams of protein and it sounds like a great combination for hypoglycemics. If you are not a hypoglycemic, but just looking to lower your sugar, this would seem to be a healthy bar -- and compared to many high-sugar protein bars on the market, it is.<br /><br />However - taking a look at the nutritional information, it also states there are 11 gm of ""sugar alcohol"" in the bar, which from reading the label I see come from Maltitol. Maltitol has a relatively high glycemic index, which is not good news for hypoglycemics. Seventy-five percent of Maltitol calories and sugar are absorbed by the body. This does impact blood glucose levels. Estimates state that Maltitol is 75% to 90% as sweet as sugar, depending on the source. It can also cause intestinal discomfort. So if you are a hypoglycemic, don't be fooled into thinking you are eating a truly 0 gm sugar bar. You are absorbing some sugar. Just plan your menu accordingly.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts per bar:<br />240 calories<br />Fat calories: 80<br />Total fat: 8 gm<br />Saturated fat: 3 gm<br />Cholesterol: 5 gm<br />Sodium: 240 mg<br />Total Carb.: 24 gm<br />Dietary Fiber: 1 gm<br />Sugars: 0 gm<br />Sugar Alcohol: 11 gm<br />Other Carb.: 10 gm<br />Protein: 20 gm<br /><br />If you are used to other brands of bars with a lot of sugar in them, ThinkThin may take some getting used to, but if you are looking for a lower-sugar alternative, give these a try.<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

"After reading other reviews I was hesitant to order the cereal, but after receiving it was glad I did.  It's true that the varieties are not equally divided in the order, but I still received an adequate amount of each.  It's so nice not having to wash another bowl and there's a nice choice waiting in the morning without having to worry if the cereal has gone stale because the lid was left open.",1.0
"I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.",1.0
"With back to school just around the corner I was looking for new snacks to put in my kids lunches.  Well, I've found a winner!! Sunny Buddies are a great snack for at home, on the go and for my kid's lunches. My 8, 6 and 3 year old all love them!  My 8 yr old said ""they're great; crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  It tastes like peanut butter & jelly!""  But what's so great is Sunny Buddies is actually NUT FREE, which makes it a perfect snack for school.  Something I love is that the back of the package has a spot to write the kids messages to send in their lunch boxes.  Sunny Buddies are a great addition to our families lunches and snacktime.",1.0

"I like it as a straight espresso shot - great aroma, not bitter with subtle sweetness, but not as much for cappuccino. Supercrema in my opinion holds up better for those who like to add milk to their espresso drink. I don't think these beans will work at all for those who like latte. I wish all these would come in smaller size because I normally go through 1 Lb of coffee every month and this bag will last me two months.",0.0
"I loved Amy's Lentil vegetable LOW SALT<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176CI"">Amy's Organic Lentil Vegetable Low Salt Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>(as it is currently called) -Product ID  B000G176CI  soup so much that I ordered a second case. When I recieved it, I found that it was not exactly the same as the soup I'd been enjoying so much. Turned out what I ordered was<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1EO64"">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Lentil Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. The LIGHT was very good, but the Low Salt(this one) was the one I prefered in taste,texture and ingredients. And it wasn't just the small difference in the sodium levels per serving - this one at 340mg, the Light at 290mg - you could always add a tiny bit more or doctor it up if you want with pepper, or Mrs. Dash no salt seasonings - this one just seemed more like a stew and had ingredients the LIGHT did not have. This one has tomatoes and spinach which really adds something extra.And really I found that it needed no doctoring up at all.<br /><br />I liked the Light in Sodium and would recommend it as well to anyone looking to reduce their sodium intake. All Amy's soups are great and made with all organic ingredients. The Lentil soups are also a good source of protien and dietary fiber. They are also a good source of Vit A,and Iron. O Cholesterol, low fat and low sugar as well.<br /><br />You can check the nutritional info(click on link on detail page) and also see all the ingredients and decide for yourself which you want to try, but I wanted to let everyone considering know that there are 2 different lower sodium lentil soups. I prefered this one.It was thicker and just had that little something extra.<br /><br />Also - I found that buying them here by the case saves quite a bit as compared to the individual cans at my local market. You may though, want to try one can of each from your market before deciding on an entire case.<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.....Laurie",1.0

"I've been a huge Jelly Belly fan all my life, but as jelly beans go, they're too expensive for regular indulgence. Belly Flops can be quite ugly, but they retain the intense and interesting flavors of their more attractive brethren. The only differences are cosmetic, generally in shape and size, and the lower price point.<br /><br />My only caveat is that the flavor distribution is irregular; you will almost certainly not get the full range of flavors, and several flavors (presumably those with particular problems on the production line) will predominate. The last batch I bought had quite a few of the Sours flavors, while the one before that had no Sours at all. Fortunately, there are only a few flavors that I dislike, but if you're pickier, this product might be too much of a gamble.",0.0

"I rated this only 3-stars as an average. When I took it out of the microwave it smelled like I was at the snack counter at the movies. Wonderful aroma! And the top third of the bucket was outta sight, great flavor and texture. But as I worked my way down through the bucket the popcorn deteriorated in flavor until the lowest third tasted like cardboard. In all fairness, it might be my microwave. I dunno. But if I got this again, I'd pop a couple tubs, scoop out the top thirds and put it in another container, and throw the rest out to the birds (figuratively only - I don't think birds receive much benefit from seasoned or buttered popcorn). So, 5-stars for the top popcorn of the tub and 1-star for the popcorn at the bottom equals 3-stars.",0.0
