"I ordered a case of 10 for $[...].00. I love this product- you cannot taste the difference in coffee, or oatmeal. I just spoon Nido in dry into anything with a lot of liquid. I don't know WHY it's so expensive from this seller.<br /><br />Here is my original review:<br /><br /> This is NOT your Mother's Powdered Milk<br /><br />I just discovered this product a couple days ago, and I am not the least bit surprised at how well it has been received. I bought it to put in coffee, in case I ran out of fresh milk or soymilk.<br /><br />I cannot tell the difference! It is enriched with vitamins and minerals, and the children's version is even better enriched with significant amounts of 19 vitamins and minerals, with a little more sugar and less fat.<br /><br />One caveat- this product is NOT fat-free, as Amazon.com states here. That would be too good to be true!<br /><br />I keep my Nido in the cupboard right next to the K-cups(coffee)and honey in my cupboard. What could be simpler?",1.0
"I bought these based on all the great reviews here. Maybe I just got a bad box, but mine were nothing like those described in all these other reviews! The cranberries were dry and tough. They were encrusted with sugar and sticky. Not very flavorful, and slightly stale tasting.<br /><br />Before trying these I had bought the Oskri brand on a lightning deal, and they were great. Plump and flavorful. But expensive, so I tried these. No comparison at all! I'm going to toss these in the trash and go back to Oskri.",0.0

"This really is a DELICIOUS product and if you like peppers especially roasted peppers you will not regret trying it.  However, it is overpriced even without considering the shipping charges.  I'm taking one star off because I have been buying the same item at a local market for much less.",0.0
"I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.",0.0

"One review said this tea tasted like dirt which, in all respect, tastes more like grass that has been in dirt.  As funny as that review was, Oolong tea is an acquired taste much like coffee or other teas.  Once you've acquired the taste, it's actually one of the better oolong teas I've tasted and probably one of the most genuine.  You get 100 bags for under $10; you can't beat that.",1.0
"My office offered this item & the Apple (Orchard Spice) one briefly a couple of months ago - I love them both. I was hoping to get some on my own for those mornings I'm too busy to eat at home. I'm hoping Amazon will offer them soon. I love the separate little packets of sugar, fruit & crunchy nuts to add to the oatmeal to taste. Another plus is the size of the cup - big enough to stir the items in once hot water has been added!",1.0

"Excellent tasting beverage is simply a combo of carbonated water and 100% fruit juice... and it sure is tasty! Out of the two flavors tried (black cherry flavor being the other), both tasted great, although the watermelon strawberry flavor was particularly appealing.

"I am not picky about chewing gums, I don't remember to have ever found one I did not like.<br />This one... well I cannot say I like. The tastes vanishes SO quickly you can barely realize what it tastes like. Literally, within a minute, any flavor is gone. The texture is harder than most gums, but that is not even the problem. The point is that it feels like having a piece of tasteless rubber in your mouth after 30 seconds of chewing. Not recommended.",0.0
"Mother's Rolled Oats are thicker cut, premium oats for those who REALLY LOVE OATS! Finest quality, cook up loose and flakey, or creamy and smooth, if you prefer. You just can't find better rolled oats! Makes awesome cookies, too, and grind up in your food processor (or blender) for meatloaf or baking!",1.0
"I love many BRM GF products, but this is not one of them.  GF baking is tricky stuff and if you have only tried rice/starch blend mixes, you'll probably love this because it does rise well, isn't gritty like rice mixes, doesn't get ""hard"" at room temp like rice, and is much spongier.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is still more to want and like in GF bread. First, there is so much bean flour that it's noticeable in the taste.  Seems that some people like this (or don't notice) and others truly detest it.  We're in the detest category.<br /><br />Second, there is actually too much rise in this unless you put it in the oven after a very short rise.  I was making dinner and was about ten minutes late putting it in.  It rose higher than you would think possible, but then collapsed in the middle - not the top, but think of someone sucking in air in their mouth and making that hollowed cheek look.  That makes for a weird shape!!!!<br /><br />Usually, this oddly shaped bread only happens when you either add too much water or when you use a lot of bean flour.  This bread could be so much better with less bean and more sorghum, millet, Montina, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or almond meal.  Probably, with a combination of the above, it would be fabulous.<br /><br />I knew there was this much bean flour when I bought it. I usually make my own and have some delicious recipes.  I try mixes for two reasons: to see if I'm missing anything and to support the companies that go out of their way to make GF products.<br /><br />I've answered my curiosity...I am not missing anything and will not be buying this again.  While too sweet, Pamela's is much better choice if you do not like the beany taste and the odd shape.",0.0
"GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)

"I would like to make this short and sweet. For the people that are experimenting and enjoying finding out what amazing things this product can do---- well done. For those of you giving it a negative review--- you're ignorant. I mean that in the nicest most literal way. As a professional Chef that has traveled the world working in many of the best restaurants in the WORLD I can tell you from first hand experience that this product is intended for things that I am guessing you just DO NOT understand. For example: Take a fish as thin as sole. You cannot actually 'sear' the fish to get nice caramelization on the flesh without overcooking it. This 'searing' is to acquire what is called the maillard reaction. The maillard reaction is the caramelization of the natural proteins, amino acids and sugars found in the meat or fish product. You do this to bring out the flavor--- it makes a HUGE difference. So, if you sear the thin filets it will overcook. Use the meat glue and you can 'glue' two filets together thus acquiring the nice brown color and NOT overcook the fish.... Easy peasy...... Get a clue and don't comment on things you don't understand. Ignorant as I mentioned before.",1.0

"I bought this on a lark after seeing that it was an energy booster. They're not kidding. I'm a grad student and rarely get enough sleep (and really, how many of us do?), but after a smoothie with a spoonful of maca in the afternoon, I fell asleep effortlessly that night and then nearly exploded out of bed the next day (badly startling my poor bf, I'm afraid--he's always been a morning person, but I generally am a hard sleeper and require lots of loud noise, multiple alarm clocks and strong coffee in the morning to get going.) I've been charging out of bed every morning since. Yet there's no caffeine jitters, no crazy buzz; you can sit quietly or go work out or read or whatever you normally do.<br /><br />The taste--well, it's got a little bit of an unpleasant bite, and I find myself adding more fruit, agave nectar or stevia to my smoothies to compensate. Maca is also sold toasted (or maybe roasted?) and is supposed to be sweeter and much tastier that way, so if the taste is bothersome and you don't care if it's raw or not, that might be a good option.",1.0

"I'm very happy with these bars and Amazon's great price & quick shipping!!!!  I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement/ snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric/ fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.

"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top",0.0

"I've used different Mio flavors in the past to flavor water. After using this product I find I prefer them to this projduct.<br /><br />For one thing, the bottle is difficult to open. I finally had to get a knife to cut open the seal. Of course, the drink sprayed all over the place.<br /><br />It states that you need one squeeze for 8 ounces of water. The instructions for 'one squeeze' aren't very scientific, and it's a matter of trial and error to get the water flavored to your taste. The first time I tried it there was not enough flavor, so I had to squeeze it twice. It'd be nice if tiny drops came out instead of a stream.<br /><br />I'm usually a big fan of fruit punch flavors, but this one was kind of odd. Not terrible but not as flavorful as the Mio flavors I've tried in the past.<br /><br />The one advantage this product has over Mio is that it includes vitamins, though I doubt there's enough to make a real difference.<br /><br />All in all, this product is just okay.",0.0

"As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.  They are very light, but need to be given SPARINGLY.  I use tiny pieces of these as special treats for my ""Charly,"" who adores them. Want to know a trick?  For those of you trying to get your dogs to eat more dry than wet food, take a few of the liver treats and literally crush the suckers into a powder.  It takes a while to do it in your hands, but you can always use anything in the kitchen to help.  Anyhoo....sprinkle just the bit over the dry dog food and VOILA!  I bet your dog will eat up the bowl.  Again, most dogs ADORE these Stewart's liver treats, so the smallest amount sprinkled will do the trick.<br /><br />My friend is a dog/cat rescuer and turned me onto Stewart's - not only because they are really good, but also because they are made in the U.S.A.  That means a lot when it comes to our pet products.<br /><br />My treats came very fast, too!!!  It's much more economical to get the larger tub and it will last a long, long time.

Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast smelled good once brewed but left a lot to be desired after tasting it.  I have the Keurig B60 and used the 8 oz cup size first.

"I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates).  They are now 2 years old.  They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver.  These dogs can chew anything.  If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed.  Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing.  Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.  So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course).  The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone.  So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Amazon at a local pet store).  These things are AWESOME.  They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days.  My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.  And the material it's made of seems to be unchewable to them (which I initially worried about, having not found anything in nature or manmade that they couldn't destroy).  I love these things.",1.0

"These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!",0.0

Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.

"I think the warnings about drug interactions should have no bearing on the product review. Obviously, if you're on a certain medication with known food interactions, you need to be cautious of certain foods. That shouldn't effect how we rate those products for the rest of the world. Medication concerns aside, the drink is very fruity, and refreshing. It is a very nice alternative to plain fruit juice or soda, and far healthier since soda contains no nutrition whatsoever.  This does taste very much like a fresh fruit juice spritzer with authentic flavor, not artificial in any way.  It doesn't have a ""canned"" taste as some fruit drinks in cans do.  I would have liked it to be a tad sweeter, but accomplished that by adding a splash of fresh fruit juice or a flavored syrup such as Torani. The flavor of the product itself is akin to an Italian soda.  I withheld one star because I thought the product straight from the can was a little overly ""fuzzy"" but fares well when poured over ice.  For those trying the pomegranate flavor, be forewarned that this is a ""blend"" including other fruit juices, not straight pom.  The flavor of pomegranate is still plentiful, but not like drinking it straight.  Overall, I think this would make a wonderful addition to the summer picnic cooler or to serve guests at a dinner party. Served in glasses, rather than a can, it would make an impressive dinner beverage to accompany an elegant meal for guests. I would recommend it.",0.0

"I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town.  On the side they had ""Natures Sport's Drink"".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The package the drink comes in is ""Tetra Pak""; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding ""natural fruit flavor"" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:<br /><br />Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you.",0.0

"I bought this cheese to use as a flavoring for microwave popcorn. I know there are lots of good reviews for this product, but I thought is was terrible.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of taste.<br /><br />This cheese has a very tangy, sour, taste to it. Very uncharacteristic of cheddar cheese. When used on popcorn, the tangy-ness of it overrides the little cheese flavor of the product. It is a taste that is very inappropriate and uncharacteristic of cheese flavored popcorn. You are much better off just buying a quality bag of cheese popcorn. Also, it doesn't stick to the popcorn very well and half of the cheese is left in the bag.<br /><br />I decided to use this stuff to make mac and cheese. I made it very simple. Butter, milk, and this cheese product. With gentle prolonged heating, and cooking down the milk to thicken, the cheese melted very well. Creamy with no lumps. The tangy, sour taste, was overwhelming. I had to throw out the mac and cheese. At least I was able to eat the popcorn.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product. If you are looking for powered cheddar cheese, try a different product before you try this one.",0.0

"I have been researching and studying canine nutrition since about 1988. Ironically, my interest sprang from a program that Hill's (makers of Science Diet) used to offer called the Small Animal Dietician program. I completed all levels that they offered and learned quite a bit about food, most especially, NOT to feed Science Diet, lol.<br />That being said, I have been showing and breeding dogs for over 20 years. I have tried virtually every high end food on the market: Core, EVO, The Honest Kitchen, Before Grain, Prairie, Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, California Natural....I could go on. The *extremely* high protein content in some of those foods can be quite dangerous, especially for puppies. I just had to euthanize my 3 year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier in December due to kidney failure, and I am certain it was brought on by being on Before Grain, Orijen & EVO as a puppy.<br />Chicken Soup is a fantastic food and a great value. I am currently feeding it to my Bullmastiff and 2 Chihuahuas, one of whom is almost 16 years old. It is my exclusive food now and as long as they don't change the formula, I see no reason to switch to another food again. The price for the quality of food in unbeatable.

"I bought these for my new wife as a gift.  We were both surprised.<br /><br />The 12 flavors are as clear and excellent as the colors, and like the famed jelly beans they DO taste like what they are claiming to!  Clean simple flavors strong enough to know what they mean to be but not so strong as to over-power your taste-buds.  I've sampled candy from the ultra-cheap to the pricey-gourmet, and these are definitely a superior product (without that Godiva-superior price).<br /><br />We've given samples to several people (so far) and they are all agreed: They're buying some, taking what's left in our hands, and they ALL call them the best gummi candy for taste they've ever had.<br /><br />Go ahead.

The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.",1.0

"This is the best gluten free pizza mix I've dealt with.  My kids think it tastes great so it's nice that we can actually eat pizza again.  The dough mixes up and rolls out easily.  I also don't have problems with it sticking to the rolling pin or pan like some of the other mixes I've used. It's best to follow the instructions exactly the first time, then adjust accordingly.  I made the mistake of baking the crust early in the day, then adding toppings in the evening.  It was like eating pizza on a cracker!  I also find I have to add a lot more milk than the mix recommends to get the dough to stick into a ball shape, so don't be surprised.  Also, when reheating it turns out much better to bake for 10 minutes in the oven than to microwave your leftovers.",1.0

"I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of ""baked chips,"" already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought ""The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite..."".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors.

While it had evaporated cane juice and molasses, a one third cup serving only had 6 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the size of the clusters. They were more like the bottom of a bag of granola, with broken pieces. I couldn't just dip into the bag and neatly grab a handful.<br /><br />However, on the whole, I really liked this product, either standing alone or in some cottage cheese with fresh fruit.",0.0
"I am so excited!  I haven't been able to find this double black soy sauce since (I worked in Boston) I shopped at the markets in Chinatown on the outskirts of downtown Boston.  The flavor of this soy sauce really makes my dishes, especially my pork lo mein, taste authentic (I guess I mean as it tasted in the restaurant).  Go easy though, the flavor is intense!  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying these wonderful imported treasures.",1.0

"Contains Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Parsley, Mint, Cilantro and Dill.  Like many others have stated, the Cilantro never grew.  I tried a replacement and it never grew either.  I have had to replace 2 motors in the Aerogarden itself. (I have 3, was so excited when I got the first one, I immediately ordered 2 more). Customer Service is easy to reach and eager to help...BUT...they keep getting complaints about the same kind of things, especially motors quitting...and have not solved the problem yet.

I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...

"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",1.0

"Personally, I love this tea, but I am more addicted to black tea than most humans.<br />This is a very decent Indian Tea. It may not be the best you ever tasted, but it is quite good as an everyday tea. It reminds me a bit of Lipton Gold loose tea (which I used to get from an Indian foods shop). It is not particularly complex (a slight maltiness, with orange overtones, but not much more beyond ""tasting like tea"").<br />It is a very full-bodied orange-pekoe type tea, with a slight astringency (""briskness""). Be careful not to steep it for too long. As long as that precaution is taken, this will satisfy the cravings for black tea oomph, if enough leaves are used.",0.0

"This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma.",0.0
"i bought these to brew in coffee for something different or to use in cooking recipes that called for cinnamon sticks, but find that these are not nearly fragrant or flavorful enough.  they get the job done well enough, and the sheer quantity makes this a decent buy, but there's got to be better quality out there and probably wouldn't purchase these again.",0.0

The tea she gave me to drink was lighter or milder on the polyphenols, with a bold fruity flavor or quality and a sweet lingering finish with an orchid like aroma.

"I bought the 6-pack of these thinking ""Hey, I bet these are way better than Slim Jim's, I LOVE THOSE THINGS, HOOOOO BOY YEAH!!!"". I was wrong, firstly they are not individually wrapped. Secondly, when you try and bite into them they will loosen a tooth.<br /><br />Not to be deterred, I used my back teeth and kept chewing and chewing until viola', success!!! I maybe shouldn't have said all those bad things, they last through like 15 or so episodes of Breaking bad, and they taste pretty good. I can best describe the taste as salty sinew-laden beef jerky.<br /><br />So if you like beef jerky, and are patient, and enjoy chewing alot, I'd say go for it. Not a bad snack. Although, my dog kept looking at me all funny.",0.0
"These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes good. I liked the drink but I'm not wild about the strawberry part of the mix.  It kind of tasted a little stale to me, not in an obvious or overt way but in the after-taste (a little). The carbonation is just right, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories.",0.0

I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove.

Ordinary domestic licorice you may have eaten in the past is a pale, anise-flavored ersatz shadow compared to this. If you remember how licorice tasted years and years ago, this is it. Kookaburra actually HAS licorice root in it; American licorice uses cheap anise oil and thus has barely any real flavor.  Warning; if you tend to high blood pressure, excessive real licorice can be bad for you--causes water retention. Aside from that I can't think of a reason not to enjoy this treat.<br /><br />My only complain is that the price for 10 oz. is a bit steep.

"Usually I am not a Starbucks fan.  I find their coffees to be bitter and generally too strong.  However, Natural Infusions Ground Vanilla coffee is a little smoother than most Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />The first thing you notice when you open the bag is a healthy, but not at all overpowering, vanilla aroma.  It is quite pleasant, providing you like the smell of vanilla.<br /><br />While brewing, the vanilla scent comes to life and will fill your kitchen.  The coffee itself is milder than most Starbucks offerings, but still not what I would consider smooth.  It still has that strong, almost bitter taste.  There is a definite flavor of vanilla in each sip, although it is a background flavor to the traditional Starbucks strong taste.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a decent cup of java, but still a tad too bold for my taste.  This ground seems very flavorful though; it would be nice to seem Starbucks tone down the bitterness a bit.<br /><br />But if you are a Starbucks lover and enjoy vanilla aroma and flavor, you may just love Natural Infusions!",0.0

"Mmmmmm, San Diego tap water. We get most of our drinking water from the lower reaches of the Colorado River, the waste drain for about 2/3 of the western US. Fortunately, the drainage basin is only sparsely populated. The water is safe. I've lived in San Diego for 49 years and there's never been a water problem of any magnitude. A lot of people won't drink it, including my wife. She'll only drink bottled water and the more expensive it is, the better it is. For a while she was drinking water imported from Figi and said it was the best water she's ever tasted. Well, you guessed it. It was also the most expensive bottled water she's ever consumed.<br /><br />Some people say that San Diego tap water smells bad. Fortunately, my sense of smell isn't that keen. A lot of people say it tastes bad. I guess my sense of taste isn't so keen either. I don't mind San Diego tap water at all. One thing I do note is that if you fill a glass and then let the glass evaporate dry, the interior of the glass is coated with a scummy white lining. Well, If you're drinking the water, you're also consuming whatever all that white stuff is. I assume it's just mineral matter which is especially common in arid areas, but who knows?<br /><br />In any case, I was recently browsing our nearby grocery store and found an interesting product. It's called MiO Liquid Water Enhancer and comes in a variety of different flavors. You put a drop, or any amount you might like, into a glass and then fill the glass with water, in my case tap water. There's no need to mix or anything. Now you have slightly flavored or enhanced tap water. The flavor I chose for trying was Berry Pomegranate. It says there's 24 servings in the little bottle, but the number would depend on how liberal you are with the little squirt you put in. I tried it a few times and prefer only a very slight enhancement, so my bottle will probably last a lot longer. I'm definitely not looking for something that tastes like soda pop. Well, the slightly enhanced San Diego tap water is kinda nice. It tastes good. The only odor I can detect is the slight fragrance of the additive. Hmmmm. This  stuff could be a big seller in areas like San Diego!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",1.0

"Usually flavored coffee is made by masking low quality ground beans with artificial flavors, and usually Starbucks roast their beans to oblivion, eliminating any subtle flavors, leaving a harsh, bitter product.  Fortunately, neither is the case here.  The beans are mildly roasted, giving a flavorful, satisfying brew.  The flavor is a complementary vanilla that blends well with the coffee.  Not a cloying, overwhelming flavor that is too common with flavored coffees.  If you want your coffee to be robust, not bitter, with a mild vanilla flavor, this is for you.",0.0

"I really enjoyed this product.  I had tasted authentic chinotto while on vacation in Italy, and wanted to enjoy it here in America after I returned.  An Italian friend living in the States told me about the San Pellegrino product, and I ordered a case, since I already enjoyed their bottled water.  I was very happy with it.  It is not identical to the brand I drank in Savona, but just as good (think Coke versus Pepsi).  My family members loved it, too, and it got used up much faster than I would have liked.  It's certainly not cheap, but it's easily worth it, if you love the taste of chinotto.<br /><br />For those who haven't tasted it, chinotto is a citrus drink which is so dark, thick, and balsamic, that it actually tastes somewhat like Coke or Dr. Pepper.  Very nice stuff.  I also have some chinotto fragrance that I bought in Savona, and it has that same rich, wonderful smell.  The bottles are small by American standards, but the product is very nice, and really should be sipped, not chugged.  This stuff probably makes excellent and very novel mixed drinks, too.",1.0

I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.<br /><br />The flavor is good. There are bits of cranberries that aren't too big nor too small. The package says ""citrus"" and there are pictures of oranges on the front, but I thought these tasted more lemony than orangey. I think I would have liked more cranberry flavor and less lemon flavor. The cookie was also not too sweet, which I tend to like better. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves. I tend to favor this, but other people used to more butter or lard might find the cookie a bit dry.<br /><br />I enjoyed eating these with sweetened tea.

"I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)

"Fusion Black Truffle Sea Salt has a definite black truffle flavor, that unlike truffle oils, actually comes from real black truffles.  Almost all truffle oils are made with a synthetic chemical that closely resembles the taste of truffles.  For those who want the real thing, this truffle salt is the cheapest way to get your truffle fix.<br /><br />The 5.5 ounce jar will last you a long time, even if you are a heavy seasoner.  I would have preferred a stronger concentration of truffle flavor in exchange for a smaller quantity of salt.  I spent twice as much for 1.5 oz of white truffle salt at a spice market, which i would purchase again over this.  With the fusion black truffle salt, I end up oversalting my food to get the amount of black truffle flavor I desire.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent, allowing for easy dispensing and storage.

"Almonds are popular because of their antioxidant capacity. The almond is rich in the antioxidant vitamin E. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and slow down the aging process (hasn't helped me in that area). The magnesium in almonds helps strengthen bones and plays a role in different enzyme processes in our body. Almonds are, like all nuts, rich in unsaturated fat.<br /><br />The nutritional value of almonds is well documented. Some time ago I read an article in a Sunday paper magazines about the health benefits of almonds and have since been eating a daily handful of these tasty, nutritious nuts. Examine the label of any almond product and you'll see that almonds are good sources of Vitamin E, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin and folate. Munch some almonds, and you'll also get a bit of calcium, magnesium, copper, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Like other nuts, almonds are calorie intense and must be eaten in moderation. After all, too much of a good thing can result in negative consequences.<br /><br />Do some study and you'll see that almonds are almost universally touted for their health benefits. The antioxidants in almonds are said to help in preventing the aging process, lowering the risk of gallstones, lowering blood pressure and lessening the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. No, munching a daily mouthful of almonds won't guarantee longevity or good health, but it's certainly a step in the right direction and most certainly is more beneficial than a mouthful of sugar-laden candy. I like that almonds are good for me and that they help me maintain my chiseled physique, but mostly I eat these crunchy wonders because they are so delicious and satisfying.<br /><br />Of all the varieties and brands of almonds I have ever eaten these are now my all time and present favorite. The chocolate coating is not what I had imagined. Instead of the milk chocolate candy coating I'd anticipated, the chocolate coating on these almonds is dry and powdery. The taste is subtle but dynamic and satisfying at the same time. Instead of an overwhelming candy sensation, one gets a complementary chocolate taste that heightens and accentuates the almond taste. I like that the dry chocolate coating doesn't insidiously stick to one hands and everything a snacker might touch. It's safe to read your favorite book or the latest edition of the Almondac while snacking on these Cocoa Roast Almonds.<br /><br />Eating these delicious nuts is an almond joy made even more delightful by playing some Almond Brothers music in the background . These nuts are so delicious that one can easily get carried away and eat too many. It's best to set aside a portion first and then seal the container.",1.0

"My work takes me on the road often, and here I am stuck again with a Tassimo in my host's house. I thought I'd contribute by buying some pods. Not unlike the other one-star reviewer on here, against my better judgement I bought the Starbucks Pods BECAUSE I love a bold Italian roast, thinking it would be better than what we get at Starbucks shops. But this is not only over-roasted, this is beyond burnt. Experiencing this allegedly great cup of coffee is akin to drinking crude oil mixed with sea water in the Gulf of Mexico.<br /><br />If you read through all the five-star reviews it is obvious what people like about SB: It's consistency. And consistent it is; consistently burnt. Several local roasters on my trips told me that what SB does is over-roast the coffee beans to an almost burnt stage so that it ALWAYS tastes the same, anywhere in the world. And that's what they really sell, not coffee, but predictability... just like McDonald's. And that's usually what the mob goes for; knowing what you're gonna get is far more comfortable, even if you know that it is bad. It is like voting for a bad president for a second term. Thank God we have term limits.<br /><br />I should have remembered my roasting friends' advice and bought anything other than SB.",0.0

"Except for a cold bottle of high-quality ginger ale, I don't often reach for ginger drinks unless for medicinal purposes. With that mindset, I tried Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix and almost wished I had saved the experience for the next time I'm stricken with a cold or flu.<br /><br />There's plenty of ginger spice here. And lemon...and an aftertaste that wasn't pleasant. Whether you call it `spicy' or `tangy' or `zesty', the drink is cloyingly gingered. I happen to like that when I'm drinking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KFVMU"">Reed'S Ginger Beer Extra Ginger Brew</a> on a hot, summer day. However, I can't recommend Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix unless you are already sick and in need of ginger to soothe your condition.<br /><br />I tested and reviewed this drink as part of Amazon's Vine program, receiving one packet for free. Too bad they didn't send a couple more. I wanted to share a cup with a couple of my foodie friends to hear their take.

A head cold. Runny nose. Head congestion. The works. So, I tried Gold Kili again, taking my own advice from the initial review.

"The PROS of this tea:<br />*ACTUAL RED TEA (and it does taste like the leaves from Thailand)...<br />*NO nasty food coloring<br />*NO gross paint taste/smell<br />*has anise (see cons) like Thai tea is supposed to<br />*adding whole spices to the water before steeping, boiling those a bit, then steeping them with the tea can be a decent alternative to handling messy loose leaves<br />*holds up to longer steep times--ie it's not the super cheap stem-filled tea most brands market as ""Thai Tea""<br />*convenient<br /><br />The CONS of this tea:<br />*Weak. Very weak. 1 bag per 6oz yields tea half the strength of the very strong stuff in (authentic) restaurants, so instead of being about fifteen cents a bag from my Asian market, it's double that... so that makes it about a dollar JUST in the bags per 18oz serving? Not a great value anymore! There's no way I could justify paying the shipping costs--which are more than 2 boxes typically--on top of higher prices in online retailers (typically--if it was a buck and had free shipping, maybe? probably not, though)<br />*the anise flavor is too subtle--ended up brewing my own spices in<br />*anise isn't the only spice typically in Thai tea, though it is the dominant one<br />*not as red as top quality black/red teas from Thailand and Sri Lanka<br /><br />OVERALL?<br /><br />If I wanted something sweet at work, while there are dozens of tea options out there, this isn't the worst choice by a long shot (but really, so many better, more flavorful teas, authentic or not)--I mean, this is nothing like the gross Pantai stuff that's not only green, not red, tea but is full of chemical yuck... it's not, though, anything like the loose leaves I get that I add spices to and brew in a commercial coffee pot (brew super strong then run the hot water through a second time--it makes the pot in under two mins, so mine turns out like good restaurants but then... most coffee makers can't handle it--the drip drip things ruin it)...<br /><br />In other words, it's okay. It's nothing spectacular but nothing like the awful mess with food dyes and chemical byproducts, either. Wouldn't waste sweetened condensed milk on it--too expensive and this isn't strong enough to handle it--but a little sugar and (real, no thickener junk) cream and it's a basic, decent cup of tea. 3*s because it's quite literally alright, not bad, not great.

"A German friend, returning to his home in New York City after visiting with family in Frankfurt am Main, brought me back a gift box of ASBACH URALT Assorted Brandy-Filled Chocolates. That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, ""Weinbrand,"" since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Amazon has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift.<br /><br />The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates. The assortment includes cherries marinated for over a year in Asbach brandy, praline, coffee and pure cognac. The chocolates are as fine as any I have had in Belgium and much less expensive. This is a real winner. 5+ Stars!<br /><br />JANA",1.0

"This is a perfectly healthy, portable and vitamin packed snack for toddlers.  My one year old loves them.  I wish the cap was just a tad bigger because the first thing he wants to do is play with it, however (much like the warning on the product says) it is too small and poses a chocking hazzard.  I love that he can either squeeze it himself or just suck the yogurt out of the opening.  The size is appropriate, for a snack, and the ease of just tossing into the diaper bag can't be beat.  It's a better deal to order on Amazon (especially subscribe and save) than purchasing in the grocery store, but still a slightly high priced snack.",0.0

"I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.

"I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.",0.0

It has all the spicy flavors you'd expect, and actually kind of has the taste of pumpkin pie. Once it's all stirred, it has a layer of foam on the top which is really pretty.  I'd suggest using a clear cup, like shown on the container, and maybe sprinkling some cinnamon or nutmeg on the top for a pretty holiday drink.  Not too much, though, because there is definitely lots of spice flavor already in the coffee.",1.0

"FONTINA VAL D'AOSTA cheese, sold by IGOURMET, is a tasty, raw-milk cheese. It is NOT the most tasty cheese I have ever had, (that place being rserved for Royal Port de Salut cheese, with Royal Havarti cheese being a close second.)  But this fontina val d'aosta cheese IS tasty, especially when allowed to stand out of the refrigerator and on the table for a while.<br /><br />This is a firm cheese, but it cuts easily with a sharp knife.  The (I hope!), edible rind of this cheese has a nice, somewhat smoother flavour, and is of a texture comparable to bread with a very slightly-more-than-normal hardness, but still delicious and edible, nontheless.  The cheese itself has a nice, but very mild flavour, and even though the ingredients do not list ""liquid smoke"", or anything smoked, in the ingredients, the very faintest of smoky flavour does come through -- at least to me.  It tastes a like very lightly-flavoured Swiss cheese.<br /><br />The ingredients listed for this cheese are simple: Unpasteurized milk, Rennet, Salt.  The salt flavour is NOT apparent in the flavour -- but if you eat enough of this cheese, you will get very thirsty, which is a sure sign of salt in anything!<br /><br />Unpasteurized, (or ""raw"") milk cheeses might -- if some at the ""august and SO very learned"" FDA have their way -- become illegal in the USA(!)  Or so I have read on the Internet.  This is the reason I bought this, and another type of unpasteurized cheese.  I've never had unpasteurized cheese before -- so I wanted to sample it before it becomes illegal!  Those ""wonderful"" fuss-budgets at the Federal Food and Drug Administration, (FDA), seeming are SO concerned about the welfare of the American people, that they fail to notice that unpasteurized cheese....and unpasteurized milk.....when carefully made, under sanitary conditions, does NOT kill anyone!  I can personally attest to drinking (legal!) raw milk....which did not taste differently, as I remember, from pasteurized milk.  Only it's supposed to have more nutrition.  It stands to reason that, if unpasteurized cheese did kill people, much of France, (where Louis Pasteur was born!), and the rest of Europe, would probably be dead by now.  But they aren't!  Will unpasteurized milk and cheese kill only Americans, but not Europeans, then?  Or is this just one more way our ""beloved"" Federal Government wants to impress their power over the rest of us -- their consituents, who voted these ""PUBLIC SERVANTS"", of ours, into office.  (Will Rogers said that he wanted to ""go down to Washington and see how our HIRED HELP is doing.""  And, in all reality, that IS what these ""powerful"" people really are...!)<br /><br />A few years ago, visiting relatives in Canada, I came upon a packet of ""Sweet N Low"" artificial sweetener.  Reading on the label that it contained CYCLAMATE, I threw it away -- because, in the USA, cyclamates have not been legal for at least 20 years, and I didn't want to injest anything that old.  Then I rememberered -cyclamates are STILL LEGAL IN CANADA.  Do cyclamates, then, kill Americans and not Canadians?  Or is this just another power-play by American ""Food and Drug"" officials?  It is all very confusing and disillusioning to someone born and bred in the (seemingly?) ""land of the brave, and home of the free"".  Or is that actually, ""the land of the slave, and the home of the thief?""<br /><br />At any rate, I do hope our beloved FDA will never make unpasteurized cheese, such as this ""Fontine Val d'Aosta"", Italian cheese, illegal.<br />It's only cheese, true -- but if they take away our freedom to eat unpasteurized cheese....what next will they take away.  Hmmm....as this IS Italian cheese.....maybe the Mafia DOES have a few good purposes, after all?",0.0

"While on a wheat-free trial diet for a month, I needed wheat pasta substitutes, and one kind of pasta I tried was this one from De Boles.<br /><br />This is my favorite shape of pasta.  This variety cooks up pretty fast, 5-7 minutes and it's great.  Because of the starch in the rice, it will boil over fast if you don't watch it!  You also need to rinse it with cold water after draining.  When this is done, it does not stick or clump up together.  It also doesn't turn hard or gummy.<br /><br />It does taste different than standard wheat pasta.  It has a brown rice flavor, and while it's not my favorite flavor in the world, it's tolerable.  I don't plan to buy this now that I'm back on wheat, but if you cannot have wheat or gluten, then it's a decent pasta.<br /><br />We had this brown rice pasta for mac -n cheese and for tuna noodle casserole.  In both you could taste the noodles' brown rice flavor, but the other flavors overpowered enough to compensate and the pasta didn't ruin the meal.<br /><br />Kids may find it disgusting, depending on how picky they are.<br /><br />I did not try this pasta with cold pasta salad, but it may not be half bad.",0.0

She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.",1.0

"Does your dog spit out his/her meds? Maybe rolls it around in his/her mouth before spitting it out all gooey &/or smashed.

A more realistic two-cup bowl is almost 2000--that's higher in sodium than any of the canned soups I eat.

"They had several dozen cases of 11.7 ounce bags of this Brown & Haley Candy Cane Roca at Jack's 99 Cent Store a couple of days before Christmas so I couldn't resist buying a few.  I was a bit worried about how a combination of toffee, chocolate, and peppermint would taste but there was no need to worry because it works just fine.  I have really enjoyed them and so has everyone else who tried them--it is very difficult to eat just one or two.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Brown & Haley Almond Roca, these are the normal little bars of buttery, crunchy toffee dipped in chocolate but without the nuts and instead they are drizzled with some pretty intensely flavored peppermint icing, like the filling in a peppermint pattie.

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.

Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

"I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of ""A Star Is Born"" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.",0.0

"Besides this I've had Nature Factor organic, Amy & Brian, Blue Monkey, and Naked coconut waters and actual coconut water from the coconuts growing in my front yard (years ago).  Based on flavor alone this one tasted like it was processed too long, a one-note sweetness and not much else.  For me what was missing is the fresh, enzyme-y, multi-note flavors Amy & Brian or other brands capture that is similar to raw coconut water. On the plus side:  no tin can off-flavors like I've experienced with Blue Monkey or an occasional can of Amy & Brian's and the price is tolerable.  Amazon delivered in excellent condition on time.

"All 5 of my cats liked both flavors preferring the Chinese chicken to the very watery pot pie. Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based ""gravy"" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat). I hope in the future Petite Cuisine produces a more cost effective 5-6 ounce can sold in a 24 can case.",0.0

I purchased this Bigelow tea in the grocery store originally and loved the taste.  I bought it because it is caffeine free and has antioxident benefits but the astounding thing is how delicious it is.  I used up one box quickly and went to purchase more but could not find it again in any of my local markets!  Then I thought of trying Amazon and was delighted to find it here and at a lower cost than I had paid in the store!  I bought a 6-pack carton and have been enjoying it daily.  The smell of this tea when opening the box is almost intoxicating!  Such a wonderful aroma and flavor. I have always liked Bigelow's products and this one certainly is one I would recommend to anyone who likes herbal teas.,1.0
Since I am not the one who eats this I can't vouch for the taste......however the dog seems to love it. One thing we as dog owners like about this food is that it cut down the gas our schnauzer had.

Amazon has this for about 10 bucks lower than pet smart so it makes it a good deal.,0.0
"Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!",1.0

"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.

"Mint mint mint! This is my review of how to love mint matcha!<br />First of all - they're both green! That helps with that feeling of ""I'm drinking a strawberry flavoured drink but it's green instead of red! Ow my brain!""<br /><br />It freshens your breath! Don't do what I do and make your matcha way too strong - otherwise associations of swallowing mouth wash come to mind. Oops!<br /><br />It's classy! Think of cr&egrave;me de menthe.

Nobody will blink at a red and green cookie - so go for it!<br /><br />It's a perfect mixer! I know this is a strange and unorthodox review, but this is finally the part when I drink the matcha and love it! Chocolate mint my friends.  I mixed a healthy dose (1/2 tsp) of Belgium Chocolate matcha with a small amount (1/4 tsp) of mint matcha! The mint is quite strong, but after experimenting I've found this to be my favourite mix.

I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.<br /><br />I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.<br /><br />In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be.

It was a good choice. I do wish they would instant package the Breakfast Blend. That is my very favorite. Pike's Place is my next fav -- but not to be had in the instant variety either. This Columbian, medium roast, is quite tasty though. I'm having a cup right now and really enjoying it. Oh by the way, for the person who said the coffee is too strong and uses only half the package and the remainder of the coffee turns to goo. Tip: Do not pour the coffee into a cup of hot water. The steam from the water instantly makes the coffee hard to pour from the package and indeed starts to dissolve the coffee. Pour the coffee into the empty cup and then seal the package.

"Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0"">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.",1.0

This KIND bar is pretty intense.  The chocolate and cherry combo create a really strong flavor. The palm kernal oil ingredient in the chocolate is a concern as that oil is not said to be very healthy.,0.0

I like sparkling juice, such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Sparkling Juice</a>, so I hoped that this would be a nice alternative to give me additional flavors.

It takes time for them to get used to it but once they did, they started doing tricks the 2nd they see the bag.<br /><br />There has been a huge increase in there coat and there energy levels. And since i started putting it in there food they even eat alot less because there getting filled more with meat as well. I support this treat for dogs, cats and ferrets :D!",1.0
"I LOVE peanut butter.  I am the kind of person who will eat it out of the jar with a spoon, all by itself!  I like it that much.  Needless to say, this love affair is dangerous for the waistline.  Enter PB2, with 45 calories per 2-tbsp serving--an absolute godsend!  I tried and liked the plain version but this chocolate one is even BETTER!  It's not just chocolate flavored, there are actually tiny little granules of chocolate goodness in it, like micro-mini chocolate chips.  Yum!  Sure, it takes a bit of mixing and experimentation to get the consistency just right, but in the end it's great as a peanut butter stand in, either in recipes, as a dessert topping, or yes, even all on its own.

"All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup.

"I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. Enriched has extra nutrition and is organic.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products, including their Heart-Wise line of products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a known toxic long-chain fatty acid. The USA FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and does not allow it in infant formula. In addition, medical studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic to humans and animals in high enough amounts (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications at the end of this review. This is a highly controversial subject, but concerns can be based on genuine medical research and not simply superstition, gullibility or hysteria. The FDA still approves at this time PABA food containers for people and infants, but they are not allowed in Canada due to documented toxic effects; this (and a hundred other examples) shows that FDA approval is not always the last word in food safety!<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor. The least expensive canola free rice milk I have found is Whole Foods ""365"" brand, which is more watery than other brands but tastes fine. (Some of the Good Karma products on Amazon have canola listed as an ingredient, but I believe that is outdated information. The Good Karma website and the products themselves do not list canola as an ingredient at this time.) I use ""365"" for cooking because it is inexpensive, and Good Karma for drinking straight because of its rich milk flavor and texture. The Good Karma chocolate flavor is super delicious and is very sweet, but unfortunately contains cane sugar rather than rice-based sweeteners.<br /><br />Some Imagine products and all the Good Karma products are also organic and made from whole grain (that is, brown) rice. Some Imagine products and some Good Karma products (the chocolate drink) contain cane sugar, which is a high glycemic sweetener, rather than a rice-based sweetener. There may be some Imagine rice milk products that are canola free, you have to check the labels, and it changes with time.<br /><br />The same canola issues (and cane sugar considerations) also apply to the Imagine frozen desert products. Good Karma makes rice-based frozen deserts that are probably canola free.<br /><br />[Health effects in humans shown to result from, or statistically linked to (different than caused by), erucic acid (_not_ Canola oil) in various medical research papers, review articles, and toxicology textbooks, include decreasing red blood cell count and autism. In animal studies there are many more documented effects of erucic acid including heart lesions and distortions of mitochondria. These studies can easily be found in the medical literature. They do not prove that the amounts of canola oil consumed by people will cause health problems, and the FDA has ruled that oil containing not more than 2% erucic acid is safe for human consumption except for infants.]<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants by US FDA regulation.

"The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!",1.0

"Tested on RUGER, 11 year old male neutered beagle type dog, 17 inches high and 25 pounds. Moderate activity level.<br />Slightly crazy, very lovable, goofy disposition, quite the momma's boy.<br /><br />Over a week I offered this food to my dog along side a bowl of his regular diet. His regular diet is Purina D/H mixed Loyall Lamb and Rice kibble.<br />He is a pretty predictable dog, and every day he chose to eat his D/H chunks out first, then a few kibbles of the Loyall, than he would eat a few bites of the Chef Michaels.<br />So, he did like it, and he did eat it.<br />There were a few things that drew my attention.<br />1. No where on the bag does it say where the ingredients are sourced. Is he eating American beef? Mexico?<br />Now, it doesn't say where his food is sourced on his D/H (Purina Dental Health) BUT, he loves that food SO MUCH and it keeps his teeth so nice I do continue to feed it to him. After all, I can't source where all the ingredients I EAT come from, so why should my dog eat better than I do? So, it isn't a major issue, but for those who really want to know, well, you will have to contact Purina.<br />2. The food felt FLUFFY and a bit greasy, and the red dyed beefy bits drifted with handling to the top. So, you have to shake before serving to get the kibbles to mix in a more uniform way before feeding. Otherwise, your dog gets a bowl of soft beefy bits and no kibble.<br />3. The kibble pieces did not seem crunchy enough to prevent tartar build up. Hummm. Perhaps after a long feeding diet of this your pet will NEED Purina D/H. I may be on to something here. I doubt this diet will do anything for dental health for your dog.<br />4. Why add artificial colors? Really? He doesn't even look at the food. At 11 years old, His sight may be questionable anyway and as a BEAGLE he doesn't look in the bowl before eating. He sniffs everything. To my dog, smell is everything. And for most dogs, I've never seen them eye each piece of kibble before chowing down. I seriously doubt dogs care if the potato bits are brown, the green bean kibbles are green, or the meat is red. Actually, after cooking, it should be brown as well. The colors can be left out, they are unnecessary. BUT, then again, as a kid who grew up on Kool-Aid, Mom enjoyed mixing up all those great colorful drinks for us, and we grew up fine (twitch twitch) but I state again, no sense in my dog eating better than me. (Now I want some red fruity punch just writing this)<br />5. Serving size is WAY too much. Each cup of this food has 270 calories. THAT IS A LOT! 28% protein and 16% fat. That is a bit more protein and fat than my guy is used to, so, it may be a bit ""rich"" for some dogs. ALSO, take notice, not all that protein is from those dried beefy looking chewy chunks. There are other sources of proteins in here, from Chicken by product meal, corn gluten, and soy. These are all sources of protein, but it may seem misleading if you think the protein is all from beef (which is, by the way, the number one ingredient)<br />6. The fat is ""animal fat"" so your guess is as good as mine. Emu? Llama? Pig? Sheep? Deer? Bison? Snake? Who knows, they should just label it ""mystery fat"" and I hope soylent green is not some of the green bits.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like I am knocking the food, and I really am not. It is DOG FOOD. My dog goes outside and eats rabbit poo, so I feel this bag of food is at least more nutritionally complete than rabbit poo.<br />And again, some of our human foods aren't much better, so I don't feel guilty feeding this to my dog while I enjoy a cool glass of Kool-Aid and chow down on some McDonald's Fries-- OCCASIONALLY.<br />In a perfect world, we would all eat nuts and berries, and fresh protein sources. If you want to feed your dog dog food you are pretty limited on types and styles. This is the junk food style dog food. I would give it occasionally as a treat (as I also do everything in moderation, I am not eating fries and KoolAid daily)<br />But I don't think I could feed this in good conscience to my dog daily, unless I added some FRESH raw meat and some pureed veggies, and probably I'd have to add something crunchy for dental health.<br /><br />This diet would probably be good for dog with rotten teeth already who find it too painful to eat regular foods and whose owners would rather put them on this instead of looking into their mouth problem.<br />Also, it would be good for picky eaters, whose owners would rather feed them this than find out why their dog's appetite is lacking.<br />This diet would also be good for training, you can take the bits out and use them as training treats. But take a rag, they leave a residue on your hands.",0.0
"PROS<br />I just LOVED these chocolates and received them February 2012 with free 2 day prime shipping. They were being sold for $19.20 and the shipping was free.  I need the health benefits of the 88% dark chocolate and these were very tasty indeed.

"My cat has a feeding tube, so we need a wet food that blenderizes well and has an extremely smooth consistency (the tube diameter is about 2 mm). Normally the vet instructs you to use Hill's Prescription Diet a/d which is high calorie. I've been using the EVO 95% Duck and it's just PERFECT for this.<br /><br />Compared to the Hill's a/d it is superior. First, it's higher calorie (217/can vs 156/can) so we can give him fewer feedings in a day. Second, it's MUCH lower in phosphorus (0.35% vs 1.00%) which is important because my cat also has kidney disease. Finally, the quality of ingredients is superior. In general I think Hill's products are garbage, and the Prescription line is no different. a/d contains meat by-products. EVO 95% duck is high quality food -- no by-products or meals, just pure meat and broth.<br /><br />I can't comment on palatability, but for tube feeds it's great!

"I was very excited about this product when I bought it - the idea of steaming and blending the food in one gadget seemed like a big time saver. However, it's not nearly as much of a time saver as it seems. The bowl is tiny, so to make enough food for just 2 days or so, I had to fill the bowl at least twice to steam the veggies(and that's about 10-15 min of steaming each time). An average-sized cauliflower took me 3 steaming session to get through, so that's almost an hour of steaming. Then the blending... unfortunately, this product is not nearly powerful enough to blend veggies quickly. Even with adding a lot of water, the food seems to get stuck and the blades are just blending what's on the bottom of the bowl and not moving the food around at all. You also can't move the food around without taking apart the whole contraption - likely because of it's baby-proof design. Several times already I ended up pulling out a regular blended and transferring the veggies to finish blending them. I've now given up on this disappointing product and will have to return it. I'm hoping that a regular-sized food processor and a steamer will do the trick in a lot less time and with much less effort.",0.0

When I need to leave the house early, I stick a straw in the container and sip it for my breakfast as I drive. My daughter-in-law who has GERD found that she tolerated Orgain well.  Love both flavors but the vanilla has the edge.",1.0
"Trying to change your eating habits is hard. But eating this snack is an easy way to incorporate more fruit and fiber into your diet. Its portability and less-perishable nature make this an easy snack to keep and take around. And it tastes good, too! And it isn't messy. What could be better?",1.0
"As a general rule, I stay clear of energy drinks and drinks with large doses of caffeine in them. However, there are occasions that I need some pep to keep me going - most often when I happen to be working a double shift or am required to work security during the night after just working that same day. In cases like those, 5-hour energy has helped me stay alert for the duration of my assignments. As the product states, there doesn't seem to be any ""crash"" after its effects wear off, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />In the past, I've just purchased these energy drinks at convenience stores, but since I have a lot of double shift days coming up, I opted to purchase an entire case this time around. The price is much more econimical when buying bulk, like this, and the product has a decently long shelf-life (20 months or so), so I'm not worried that I'll be letting some of it expire before I use it.<br /><br />I can't compare this to a lot of other similar products, because - as I stated above - I don't use them frequently, and this is the only energy drink I have ever used. Because it works for me, I don't see any need to try other products, such as Red Bull or Monster, etc.",0.0
"These crackers are the best I've found, and my husband has tried them all. I'm the organic nut and I've slowly been converting him from conventional to organic. I'll compromise, but he won't, so whatever organic products I give him have to be as good as or better than what he's accustomed to, and Late July crackers fit the bill.",1.0
"This is the best trail mix I have ever eaten.  I wish that it was available at a store near me, but I can order it from Amazon if that's the way it goes.  It is delicious, really takes care of my sweet tooth, and is crunchy to boot!  I love it!",1.0
"This tea did not taste like I expected it to.  For a long time I have been using the loose leaf White tea with Jasmine from EnjoyingTeas.com and have been really happy with it.  But I wanted the portability that tea bags offer and EnjoyingTeas did not have any product to offer. So I purchased ""REPUBLIC OF TEA Asian Jasmine White Tea"" at Cost Plus World market for about $14.<br /><br />When I opened the canister, it did not smell like jasmine, but more of a rancid candy smell.  Jasmine usually has a sweet floral scent and taste, and marries well with green and white teas.  This tea did not smell or taste like that,  It almost smelled like it was mixed up with the Orange flavored white tea that they offer.  I used Sparkletts bottled water since I am not a fan of the tap water taste in tea, and even with the better water, there was no light tea taste like there usually is with white tea.  The tea did turn a golden yellow like it should have, and but had a tang taste that did not taste like jasmine.  With tap water one could only imagine that the taste would be much worse, at least where I live.  I have read elsewhere that the tea used in tea bags is usually lower grade, and usually tastes that way. I will resort to buying a box of tea filters/bags and make my own tea bags with the loose leaf tea that I already have.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are familair with the taste of white teas, these tea bags will only be a dissappointment.  Try the loose leaf White tea with jasmine instead.",0.0

"This was my first purchase of Celestial Seasonings tea, but definitely not my last. The Honey Vanilla Chamomile tea tastes superb and I can't wait to try their other flavors. Although they call it ""honey vanilla"" chamomile, the orange peel dominates the taste, but this is not a bad thing (if you like orange ;-). Good packaging and competitive pricing (especially when compared to Twinings) as well.",1.0
"I love the packaging for this brand, but yuck!  The flours used in this mixes has a really bad after taste.  They were so bad we threw the whole pancake batch out and the rest we didn't use.

"A number of reviewers have complained that heat has destroyed these delicious bars. Note carefully that now Amazon's supplier of these ships the bars in a styrofoam box with an ice back, so that the bars arrive cool on arrive.

"The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.

"I got this and it sat in my shelf for a while because I didn't really expect much. Then I made it one night to share with my son (2) and daughter (4) and we all loved it! My daughter has celiac and is super picky, so I was happy it said ""gluten free"" right on the box. And it was so good - we ate the other box we had too (peanut flavor). Both were fantastic, the Pad thai is a little more spicy (but not too much). I was so surprised it was so good, I can't wait to get more!",1.0
"These are so delicious. They have a light carmel flavor that really makes them stand out from the original flavor. These are a great healthy snack. The normal price is really not a good deal, but I purchased them when they were on special for around $20. That price, you can't beat.<br /><br />I give this three stars, just based on the price. It is 5 stars for flavor, but like 2 stars for how expensive they are (at least right now). Wait for them to go on sale!",0.0
"While it doesn't always work for five hours, this energy drink works well for me.

I probably would not drink this for the flavor alone.  Grape seems to taste the best.",0.0
"In preparation for going back to work, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep my breastmilk supply up to keep up with my baby.  I tried Motherlove More Milk Two Alcohol Free because Motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet I got from my lactation consultant.  It didn't work for me.  So then I tried More Milk Plus Alcohol Free.  That also didn't work for me.  Finally after talking to a couple of people, they recommended Fenugreek, which I had read about before, but wanted to give Motherlove's More Milk product line a try because of all the great reviews I read.  I ordered Motherlove's Fenugreek, and finally my breastmilk supply started to go up.<br /><br />Before Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total (1 to 1.5 oz on left side and 1.5 to 2 oz on right side).  By the time I finished a 4 oz bottle of Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was still pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total (up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right side).<br /><br />I was worried about keeping up with my baby, but now my baby can't keep up with me.  After using Fenugreek for about a month, I'll have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and I now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer, and running out of room to store any more!<br /><br />Note: Although your supply increases, it does eventually plateau.  After finishing the Motherlove's Fenugreek, I switched to Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules because they're a fraction of the price, and you can take them with meals.  Motherlove recommends you avoid water 20 minutes before and after taking their product.  The Nature's Way capsules is maintaining my supply that Motherlove's started.<br /><br />In fact, now that I'm back to work, after my last pump in the morning, it will be 6 to 8 hours before I get to pump again at lunch at work, then another 4 to 5 hours after that before I get to pump again when I return home.  I then pump every 3 to 5 hours from the time I get home to the last time before work in the morning.  Even though I'm pumping less often than before (before it was after each feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours in a 24 hour span), I'm still pumping a very minimum of 5 oz total.  For those the times I have to go longer between pumps (more than 6 hours) I will pump up to a maximum of 11 to 12 oz total depending on how long I had to go between pumps.",1.0
"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.

It is very strong at first (I purchased cinnamon flavor), but the flavor subsides quickly.  If you keep it in your mouth though, you begin to taste it again.  Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away.  Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs.",0.0
